Programming Your Brand Through The Internet 

Chapter 0: WHY? 

First I want to start by introducing myself my name is George Perez and I am the president of MOOTENS productions. 

It is run with my wife Tracie Dang-Perez who is the CEO 

We are dual owning the business. 

We started MOOTENS productions in 2015 when there was a need to be filled where I wanted to make a cute gift to my wife during Christmas and I didn't have any money and I wanted to make something meaningful. 

Instead of doing an alternative, I put all of my time energy and space into creating a cute little logo of half of our cats' faces: Moo and Mittens. 

We combined the faces together and made MOOTENS productions. 

So from here (Chapter 0) I'm going to go over a little bit about what the structure of how we got here. 

This is going to be very important along the journey and along the story of explaining why we are here. 

I grew up in Southern California I was born on August 4th 1992. 

My parents were born in Mexico. They are both American citizens now. 

We grew up moving around to different houses and cities. 


Every moment of our lives we were taught:

Go to school. 

Do your hundred percent. 

Work hard. 

Hopefully one day own a house.

Have a family and be successful.

Be able to do what we want to do. 

As we grow up in life we realize that (most) everything  that society teaches us in terms of: 

Schooling. 

What is success. 

what is life. 

What is work. 

What is money. 

All of that starts to fall apart when we actually live our lives and understand what life REALLY is. 

So this book is a not only a "book" in terms of a "text" book. 

This program is also a video series, audiobook, and a HyperMedia Course (everything combined into sections).

If you are Reading, Watching, or Paying, 

Thank you. 

Thank you for sharing our energy and learning together. 

Contact me at contact@MOOTENS.org or 424-440-4837. 

I love you.
