Beautiful day.

I have noticed more negative energy.

I am in full control. Negative energy can sometimes take over when we are not fully aware of our thoughts feelings and actions.




---


How to use my time, energy, and space to the most of our advantage?

Always, every day.

My sleep schedule needs to be more efficient.

Sometimes I don't work on things 100% (Multitasking is not 100%).

I do more 100% more consistenlty. Now more than ever I have ever done in my life.

Yet I still want more. I want more because I know I can do more.

We are together. I love you.

I need to improve every aspect of our lives.

It is my duty to succeed in acheiving everything I put my full force 100% best energy into doing.

100% full force.

I do not want to feel like I am spinning my wheels. 

I understand what I need to do: in my head. But I need to be more efficient, cogniscent, and produce more value.


Need to produce more value. More "physical" value.

Digital as well.

Social media posting should be 24/7 and full force.

A bottleneck is the "preparation" and "packaging" and connecting all WORK and OUTPUT so it is done the most efficient way possible.

I have an idea of putting the computer in the living room.

Computers.

Livestream setup for the living room.

---

I am imagining our ideal lives.

Tracie's "garage" computer. in the living room?

Studio should be in the garage area of Tracie's Section.

The setup of webcams need to be first?

There is also the idea to make the Hypermedia Courses in front of the white screen in the garage.

Set up t7i with memory card along with the shotgun mucrophone. Set up the tripod. Lighting Ring light.

Have the script on my phone, github already. 

The process of recording:

Start talking to the camera and talk about the chapter. and Sections.

The sections in the chapter are its own recordings.

The recording of the video and audio:


For each section:
Folder per chapter
mp4 file filmed from t7i along white background
create mp3 file
Run mp3 file through audio to text.

markdown file and folders with the chapters


---

# Chapter

> Epilogue quick 1 minute intro.

## Section 

Text text text etc.


## Section

text text text text etc.

---

The result at this point will be a folder with mp3 files and text files.

Sorting through VS code is the simplest way to program and create this.


---

Video will be stiched together:


Each section will be sorted and final will be:

Individual Sections ~10 minutes

Chapter (made up of sections) ~>Hour

supplemental resources (text, links, images, templates, videos, examples)


---

Final hypermedia course will be a "secret link"
