All right chapter 0 why academics so I graduated from Southern California high school Henry J Kaiser High School it was in Fontana and Fontana is famous for the steel mill and the speedway it was actually a pound city that was made in order to produce steel for the war and others a story. Aziz I would run out of gas by the time they production plant so they wouldn't be able to bond it and it's an hour East from LA and from there that steel mill all those families working for the effort needed to have health care so one of the owners from the Kaiser steel mill Kaiser High School and Kaiser health care so I graduated with a 3.8 in high school I was very smart growing up I read out on a high reading level I was always getting mad because I was pushed towards that I remember having to memorize the times tables up to 10 by the time I was like first second grade actually skip first grade because I was so smart I got straight A's in second grade but I was held back I was too short and they said that I would get bullied if I moved on and I did very good in a high school because I knew the game the game was just memorization it was just read this part of the textbook answer these questions and you're testing to be based on that is the lowest form of education but that's what we were talking and I went to Community College with the goal to become a registered nurse again. Very similar it is lots of memorization but you have to apply those memorization along with skills to provide patient care to be a nurse so everything that I through High School community College California State University Sacramento where I got my. Science in nursing I'm a registered nurse everything has taught me where I am when I'm going to be doing in the future because of everything that I've learned I used to be wanting to compartmentalize my life into o I only do this or I'm only there for I do this but in reality all of my experiences make me who I am and from there it makes up the volume. So the reason why I'm bringing this up in this type of media course of programming and brown through the internet is to let you know that you don't necessarily need a marketing background for an art. Programming. Literally you can create whatever the f*** you want to create if you just put your hundred percent full form and instead of spinning your wheels and trying to figure everything out and try to learn from different people and do things kind of halfway and experiment I'm going to give you the guidelines that all of the other brands that are successful and companies and government Healthcare everything we're going to use the industry-standard launching point to where we're going to be growing our brand and where we're going to be disseminating our ideas and information into the whole world and this structure is through Bluetooth production and the whole guideline everything is compartmentalize into a box called programming your brain to the Internet so after I went to school and I got my nursing degree my. By the nursing I got my first job as a nurse I was a primary care nurse at a local federally qualified Health Center which is code word for we accept anyone and everyone in all of my skills into being able to provide the best care to everyone who came in through our doors and I use my experience of working at Jack In The Box and of my schooling and of everything in order to provide the best care and because of that I thrive everywhere I go no matter what position I am placed in I guarantee that I am able to make the most down call positive impact because of all of my experience and instead of focusing just on being a nurse and having that aspect I use my education in order to achieve everything in Care Medical Care Health Care to a person that is sick and come in through some door no we need to provide this experience and education to everyone in the world and the healthcare Optical programming your brand through the internet is more months and its thoughts feelings and actions. And there's a lot of mental health advice that is disseminated through this program but the basic idea of the Nursing degree and the healthcare screen back to be committed to do what the f*** you want to do if you are feeling anxious and you're unsure healing. Normal feeling to have okay you need to stop right talk meditate draw you need to work out. He can't just be how deep down you to push it down for sure but it's not the best way to live because you're not doing what you want to be doing do you really want to be feeling that. You don't talk that the reason why you get that feeling is that discomfort is you knowing that you're not doing weird. What you doing so lenient about this grill the most achieve everything you want to achieve through Massive Action every limitation that there is in life with Ruby time energy space everything can be over, massive Action and the amount of Massive Action that you literally Corley how much you get back and you decide how much action you're going to put but I'm telling you it should be. Do what the f*** you want to do all right next thing when you go over how I came to the realization why I have this mindset and where it comes from next thing is going to be my set with the terms of the people like the retirement and the existential crisis just setting up the structure up before hypermedia course
