Chapter 0: Family History

The history of my dad's side:

My dad's name is Jose De Jesus Perez and he grew up in a small farm town.


Apozol, Guadalajara.

He has this story of being able to own a radio.

They're one of the first families to own a radio in the village.

Batteries were a commodity so they had to take out a big D batteries and put them out of the sun and that would recharge it enough to have the radio play the local stations.


My dad left Mexico when he was 15 he was helping with the farm and at 15 he had the opportunity to go to the "new world" which the United States.


 Just propertunities, for jobs.
 
 It was a new world to him.
 
 My grandpa had worked on the U.S. Railroad and there's a lot of history beyond that.
 
 My dad came, he worked, he met my mom.
 
 
 They were childhood friends in terms of the village that theygroup in in was small.
 
 In those rural towns of Mexico, every one really knows every so everyone was not surprised when they were together (I'm assuming).
 
 
 He worked his ass off and he showed us what hard work really is.
 
 
 When I think of the impact that my dad had on me:
 
 For sure one of the main things are:
 
 Working your ass off.
 
 Working fucking hard.
 
 Working at 100%
 
 I thank you because I am who I am because of you.
 
 The idea of where we come from and everything that we've gone through is nothing compared to what our parents had to go through.
 
 
 The idea of this life, of having children, of continuing your seed and your genetics:
 
 We want to make our lives "easier" for us.
 
 "Easier".
 
 We also want to make it "easier" for our kids.
 
 "Easier" really means:
 

 More opportunities.
 
 More education.
 
 More tools.
 
 More resources.
 
 To be able to achieve everything we want to achieve
 
 The "typical" way is schooling.
 
 Right?
 
 We go to school.
 
 we get our education.
 
 
 We get our degree, our GPA.
 
 We get a job based on that degree.
 
 We save up money to buy a house and everything.
 
 We for sure are following along in those paths and in that journey, but:
 
 That is not "THE" correct path  when we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 When we are held down by these limitations of:
 
 "Work".
 
 We feel like we're "busy".
 
 Or feel like we're tired.
 
 
 That means we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 So if you are doing what you want to be doing then you're going to have lots of energy, feel full and excited.
 
 The other key to this is you have to be obsessed with what you want to do.

 AND DO IT.
 
 If you are obsessed and if you are commited with what you want to achieve and you do everything that you want to do at 100%
 
 What's going to be the result?
 
 You're going to ffucking achieve everything you want to achieve!
 
 You have to keep working on it and you only stop when you die.
 
 Retirement is a myth!
 
 You are going to continue to work.
 
 Continue to live your best life until the moment that you die.
 
 This idea that you work, work, work and then all of a sudden he just stop is not the right idea.
 
 Every single moment. Earth in this reality you are working every time you breathe human table leaving. You do nothing like doing nothing is a lot of work a lot of work so let's go ahead and do what the f*** you want to do and I think our parents think our family think our connection big are ancestors are lineage because we would not be here without the help of them and it's our job to continue that and continue to provide the best possible life for everyone not only our kids but our children from the earth everyone even if they're strangers even the front of another Nation we need to do our best buy us doing our best on map so thank you for doing your back when I'm better you're better when you're better I'm better when we're going to continue on over. Academic aspect of the. Information about me and we're all of this is coming from because there is a certain approach of how to view with problems and depending on the educational experiences that you have different ways of approaching things but I'm going to show you my background just so you have some experience and help me to really help me but overall because we are here right now in this very moment everything that happened was exactly the way it's supposed to happen all right I want to give a little bit more emphasis on my mom's story so she was a group with my both of my aunts and my grandma has four of them three sisters and the mom or Grandpa was not a very good provider so he decided to live the life that he lived and he suffered greatly for it but because he suffered later on in his life to have a good life of what he wanted to live without our family without his daughters without his wife then ultimately my mom's side of the family suffered and my grandpa was going to be suffered at his end of life so because my grandpa was not a part of our family my grandma and my mom and aunts have to provide for themselves my grandma have this story she has a she needed to make money so she would make Jello for neighborhood she would make big batches of Jell-O she would sell to the local people who would then take that Jello break it up and then sell it themselves profit and then my mom and aunts what else to do theme string thing showing that type type of work as well as having a different job they also built their house from the ground up all by themselves and that entrepreneurial ship type of drive for sure is a big part of what makes me me and my mom and hurts. Reality combined with my dad hard work ethic and made me who I am so I am nothing but proud of where I come from and the Legacy. Stop thank you

All right chapter 0 why academics so I graduated from Southern California high school Henry J Kaiser High School it was in Fontana and Fontana is famous for the steel mill and the speedway it was actually a pound city that was made in order to produce steel for the war and others a story. Aziz I would run out of gas by the time they production plant so they wouldn't be able to bond it and it's an hour East from LA and from there that steel mill all those families working for the effort needed to have health care so one of the owners from the Kaiser steel mill Kaiser High School and Kaiser health care so I graduated with a 3.8 in high school I was very smart growing up I read out on a high reading level I was always getting mad because I was pushed towards that I remember having to memorize the times tables up to 10 by the time I was like first second grade actually skip first grade because I was so smart I got straight A's in second grade but I was held back I was too short and they said that I would get bullied if I moved on and I did very good in a high school because I knew the game the game was just memorization it was just read this part of the textbook answer these questions and you're testing to be based on that is the lowest form of education but that's what we were talking and I went to Community College with the goal to become a registered nurse again. Very similar it is lots of memorization but you have to apply those memorization along with skills to provide patient care to be a nurse so everything that I through High School community College California State University Sacramento where I got my. Science in nursing I'm a registered nurse everything has taught me where I am when I'm going to be doing in the future because of everything that I've learned I used to be wanting to compartmentalize my life into o I only do this or I'm only there for I do this but in reality all of my experiences make me who I am and from there it makes up the volume. So the reason why I'm bringing this up in this type of media course of programming and brown through the internet is to let you know that you don't necessarily need a marketing background for an art. Programming. Literally you can create whatever the f*** you want to create if you just put your hundred percent full form and instead of spinning your wheels and trying to figure everything out and try to learn from different people and do things kind of halfway and experiment I'm going to give you the guidelines that all of the other brands that are successful and companies and government Healthcare everything we're going to use the industry-standard launching point to where we're going to be growing our brand and where we're going to be disseminating our ideas and information into the whole world and this structure is through Bluetooth production and the whole guideline everything is compartmentalize into a box called programming your brain to the Internet so after I went to school and I got my nursing degree my. By the nursing I got my first job as a nurse I was a primary care nurse at a local federally qualified Health Center which is code word for we accept anyone and everyone in all of my skills into being able to provide the best care to everyone who came in through our doors and I use my experience of working at Jack In The Box and of my schooling and of everything in order to provide the best care and because of that I thrive everywhere I go no matter what position I am placed in I guarantee that I am able to make the most down call positive impact because of all of my experience and instead of focusing just on being a nurse and having that aspect I use my education in order to achieve everything in Care Medical Care Health Care to a person that is sick and come in through some door no we need to provide this experience and education to everyone in the world and the healthcare Optical programming your brand through the internet is more months and its thoughts feelings and actions. And there's a lot of mental health advice that is disseminated through this program but the basic idea of the Nursing degree and the healthcare screen back to be committed to do what the f*** you want to do if you are feeling anxious and you're unsure healing. Normal feeling to have okay you need to stop right talk meditate draw you need to work out. He can't just be how deep down you to push it down for sure but it's not the best way to live because you're not doing what you want to be doing do you really want to be feeling that. You don't talk that the reason why you get that feeling is that discomfort is you knowing that you're not doing weird. What you doing so lenient about this grill the most achieve everything you want to achieve through Massive Action every limitation that there is in life with Ruby time energy space everything can be over, massive Action and the amount of Massive Action that you literally Corley how much you get back and you decide how much action you're going to put but I'm telling you it should be. Do what the f*** you want to do all right next thing when you go over how I came to the realization why I have this mindset and where it comes from next thing is going to be my set with the terms of the people like the retirement and the existential crisis just setting up the structure up before hypermedia course

All right we're to go over some real s*** right now we are going over programming your brand through the internet chapter 0 Y and now we're going on to be existential crisis moment. Realized what the f*** do I need to be doing so this realization if HIPAA need this thing. I feel like everyone has this moment and everyone has these moments where they can look back and they can say okay this thing that happened it happened this way and now I'm here because of that but what does that mean what does that mean in order to change there needs to be a spark within spark that's how it starts and then the fire goes and then eventually. Inferno and. Got your stool that's your spirit that's your energy. F*** you want to be doing so. Markdown talking about is the spark that pushed me into realizing what do I want to be doing what's like what is this what is this world what are we doing so how I got there is my whole life my whole life I wanted to be successful to have a house to have a wife have a family provides the most impact be positive live that good life but really I was so caught up so, and with achieving what I thought I need to achieve which was. Education. Job the getting a new car and moving in with the girlfriend now why and having that stable job having that ink having. $3 an hour $40 I started with $31 power and I moved in with Tracy we have an apartment we had our cats and but you don't want to achieve I was a nurse I got a job now I had a car I don't have to worry about it breaking down now we're thinking about buying a house to this life is is not good is not good because there's no growth that was happening during that time Tracy was growing she was doing her modeling she was taking time and energy and space to build program to build herself to developer skills hobbies and interests and I I cheated you want to achieve I got my license I got my degree I did everything eventually maybe I would become a provider a nurse practitioner and something else but... Part of what I really wanted to be doing because I work my whole life to achieve what I wanted to achieve which was to become a nurse and registered nurse and now that it was here now what I said that's it no that's not it so we push forward we got our house we moved in we got everything set up exactly how we wanted to set it up we tore down the wall we renovated the kitchen the bathroom and I have my computer I have my objects my things we would go to restaurant we were not really worrying about money that's life I do know how to cope because I would do a hundred percent at work but when I would do so much of my hundred percent at work I would have to come home and be exhausted I think I would have to come home and be exhausted that was the Trap. That I had put myself I put those limitation onto my life they work hundred percent go to work and then come home and do nothing yeah I work so hard all day that I die go to do nothing and just enjoy life and be comfortable and decided but I know that. Not the back way to live because you're not growing you're not changing Bridget stag and that is not a good way to live so how would I cope well 8 to 5 is Monday through Friday. Work schedule I would come home 5 p.m. Turn off my clothes put on my home clothes make something to eat turn on the projector go on YouTube and Just auto play all day just YouTube video after video after video after video and not healthy not healthy at all why I come home and I just plot in front of the couch and I just get all of the con all these videos on the sound is it numb me out while I just push everything else. At Pinewood progressed I would start getting anxiety underlying anxiety this feeling. Do you that would grow more and more and more and more and more I would not grow just like you do something good and something else could happen they something else good and something more positive comes to you as well I do nothing I do nothing at home. So the existential moment. Was that I Came Upon it was around 1 or 2 a.m. I was watching a bunch of YouTube videos on auto-play and call the next video. I'm about to play was about Bitcoin and for some reason or another I had the YouTube I saw the recommended videos and then the auto until you see what the next video. And for the past seven eight hours. The projector whirring overhead I did not even touch the keyboard because I would just let the YouTube algorithm feed me whatever I want going to feed me and I went down this rabbit hole news bloopers then. And then. Just other information and then it the YouTube algorithm got to a point recommend me a video about Bitcoin and something inside of me something decided to know I don't watch that let me go to the next one I have to stop and think what am I doing i'm literally the moment where I decided I don't want to watch this and I took that action II I found myself on my way over way what am I doing why at this moment why am I so averse to going down this path and I realize now that that was the discomfort I did not want to watch you because it was something new something that I have been pushing down and that pushing down was a Bitcoin is the money I read about it in 2010/2011 sometime I don't have to watch it and just that. Just because I know what it is I don't want to watch it why am I so averse to watching this I remember this moment specifically because this was one of my existential crisis moments where I realized my actions and I watched that video and I just got this feeling of Goosebumps it was just this feeling. I was just watching over me I had no f****** idea what they Quinn was what it really mad for the future was going or what it really was and I watch. I forced myself to watch. And I realized I have no idea what the f*** this is and the more I started doing research into it the more I realized oh my God this and future I thought I knew what it was and here is the answer as to what is money what is line what is job what is this reality is world what are we doing what are we working towards money cardi of money put that what is that like just that moment like we're waiting for. So you can buy a projector so you can consume contact when I went down that rabbit-hole I open them my eyes really asked to what is this reality what is this world this Earth these nations in governments this money this form of control what is this what is this instead of going to work on your bass coming consuming content being entertained getting my bread and circuses eating fast food spending money working through a hundred percent being stressed not coping not growing. Do you want to be doing and from that moment on this was around February 2018 I'm late February I just turn my life around again my light turned around from that spark from that moment that I have to look back into my life and think what the f*** what is this what is money what is this like what am I working toward what are we working toward what is this what does it mean to be a human we're all Spiritual Beings having a human experience I realize that now but like what we doing so the moment. You we have that spark. Stop going you can either. And make that go away turn it down even more or you can feed into it you can feed it if you can be like that what is that I don't do what I'm supposed to be doing so whatever that moment is for you you have to decide you have to make it real you can't just only has kind of that thing that kind of over there no you have to be able to explain it because that makes you who you are the better you are able to verbalize your thoughts feelings the better you're able to control them and then the bed rate while you're able to achieve everything you want to achieve so that was my little existential moment story others definitely more Tiffany moments draw that I had and I'm going to continue to have but that is one of the main reasons why I am here today from that spark that broke me out of that Loop of give me the consumer and just being a hard worker and not doing what I want to be doing so now I'm going to talk about the programming idea my education my background and a self-taught developer a programmer and I've only been programming or around the year and I am already at that level where I'm able to cheat everything I want to achieve using all of the Technologies which is HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the building block the internet and that's literally what's needed to program for brown through the internet even if you don't know specifically as long as you know the details of what it is and what it does and then you're able to just out sort all those things that you don't want to do or that you are able to do what you want to do using the building block I showed you hear through rocket internet program
