Chapter 0: Family History

The history of my dad's side:

My dad's name is Jose De Jesus Perez and he grew up in a small farm town.


Apozol, Guadalajara.

He has this story of being able to own a radio.

They're one of the first families to own a radio in the village.

Batteries were a commodity so they had to take out a big D batteries and put them out of the sun and that would recharge it enough to have the radio play the local stations.


My dad left Mexico when he was 15 he was helping with the farm and at 15 he had the opportunity to go to the "new world" which the United States.


 Just propertunities, for jobs.
 
 It was a new world to him.
 
 My grandpa had worked on the U.S. Railroad and there's a lot of history beyond that.
 
 My dad came, he worked, he met my mom.
 
 
 They were childhood friends in terms of the village that theygroup in in was small.
 
 In those rural towns of Mexico, every one really knows every so everyone was not surprised when they were together (I'm assuming).
 
 
 He worked his ass off and he showed us what hard work really is.
 
 
 When I think of the impact that my dad had on me:
 
 For sure one of the main things are:
 
 Working your ass off.
 
 Working fucking hard.
 
 Working at 100%
 
 I thank you because I am who I am because of you.
 
 The idea of where we come from and everything that we've gone through is nothing compared to what our parents had to go through.
 
 
 The idea of this life, of having children, of continuing your seed and your genetics:
 
 We want to make our lives "easier" for us.
 
 "Easier".
 
 We also want to make it "easier" for our kids.
 
 "Easier" really means:
 

 More opportunities.
 
 More education.
 
 More tools.
 
 More resources.
 
 To be able to achieve everything we want to achieve
 
 The "typical" way is schooling.
 
 Right?
 
 We go to school.
 
 we get our education.
 
 
 We get our degree, our GPA.
 
 We get a job based on that degree.
 
 We save up money to buy a house and everything.
 
 We for sure are following along in those paths and in that journey, but:
 
 That is not "THE" correct path  when we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 When we are held down by these limitations of:
 
 "Work".
 
 We feel like we're "busy".
 
 Or feel like we're tired.
 
 
 That means we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 So if you are doing what you want to be doing then you're going to have lots of energy, feel full and excited.
 
 The other key to this is you have to be obsessed with what you want to do.

 AND DO IT.
 
 If you are obsessed and if you are commited with what you want to achieve and you do everything that you want to do at 100%
 
 What's going to be the result?
 
 You're going to ffucking achieve everything you want to achieve!
 
 You have to keep working on it and you only stop when you die.
 
 Retirement is a myth!
 
 You are going to continue to work.
 
 Continue to live your best life until the moment that you die.
 
 This idea that you work, work, work and then all of a sudden he just stop is not the right idea.
 
 Every single moment. Earth in this reality you are working every time you breathe human table leaving. You do nothing like doing nothing is a lot of work a lot of work so let's go ahead and do what the f*** you want to do and I think our parents think our family think our connection big are ancestors are lineage because we would not be here without the help of them and it's our job to continue that and continue to provide the best possible life for everyone not only our kids but our children from the earth everyone even if they're strangers even the front of another Nation we need to do our best buy us doing our best on map so thank you for doing your back when I'm better you're better when you're better I'm better when we're going to continue on over. Academic aspect of the. Information about me and we're all of this is coming from because there is a certain approach of how to view with problems and depending on the educational experiences that you have different ways of approaching things but I'm going to show you my background just so you have some experience and help me to really help me but overall because we are here right now in this very moment everything that happened was exactly the way it's supposed to happen all right I want to give a little bit more emphasis on my mom's story so she was a group with my both of my aunts and my grandma has four of them three sisters and the mom or Grandpa was not a very good provider so he decided to live the life that he lived and he suffered greatly for it but because he suffered later on in his life to have a good life of what he wanted to live without our family without his daughters without his wife then ultimately my mom's side of the family suffered and my grandpa was going to be suffered at his end of life so because my grandpa was not a part of our family my grandma and my mom and aunts have to provide for themselves my grandma have this story she has a she needed to make money so she would make Jello for neighborhood she would make big batches of Jell-O she would sell to the local people who would then take that Jello break it up and then sell it themselves profit and then my mom and aunts what else to do theme string thing showing that type type of work as well as having a different job they also built their house from the ground up all by themselves and that entrepreneurial ship type of drive for sure is a big part of what makes me me and my mom and hurts. Reality combined with my dad hard work ethic and made me who I am so I am nothing but proud of where I come from and the Legacy. Stop thank you

All right chapter 0 why academics so I graduated from Southern California high school Henry J Kaiser High School it was in Fontana and Fontana is famous for the steel mill and the speedway it was actually a pound city that was made in order to produce steel for the war and others a story. Aziz I would run out of gas by the time they production plant so they wouldn't be able to bond it and it's an hour East from LA and from there that steel mill all those families working for the effort needed to have health care so one of the owners from the Kaiser steel mill Kaiser High School and Kaiser health care so I graduated with a 3.8 in high school I was very smart growing up I read out on a high reading level I was always getting mad because I was pushed towards that I remember having to memorize the times tables up to 10 by the time I was like first second grade actually skip first grade because I was so smart I got straight A's in second grade but I was held back I was too short and they said that I would get bullied if I moved on and I did very good in a high school because I knew the game the game was just memorization it was just read this part of the textbook answer these questions and you're testing to be based on that is the lowest form of education but that's what we were talking and I went to Community College with the goal to become a registered nurse again. Very similar it is lots of memorization but you have to apply those memorization along with skills to provide patient care to be a nurse so everything that I through High School community College California State University Sacramento where I got my. Science in nursing I'm a registered nurse everything has taught me where I am when I'm going to be doing in the future because of everything that I've learned I used to be wanting to compartmentalize my life into o I only do this or I'm only there for I do this but in reality all of my experiences make me who I am and from there it makes up the volume. So the reason why I'm bringing this up in this type of media course of programming and brown through the internet is to let you know that you don't necessarily need a marketing background for an art. Programming. Literally you can create whatever the f*** you want to create if you just put your hundred percent full form and instead of spinning your wheels and trying to figure everything out and try to learn from different people and do things kind of halfway and experiment I'm going to give you the guidelines that all of the other brands that are successful and companies and government Healthcare everything we're going to use the industry-standard launching point to where we're going to be growing our brand and where we're going to be disseminating our ideas and information into the whole world and this structure is through Bluetooth production and the whole guideline everything is compartmentalize into a box called programming your brain to the Internet so after I went to school and I got my nursing degree my. By the nursing I got my first job as a nurse I was a primary care nurse at a local federally qualified Health Center which is code word for we accept anyone and everyone in all of my skills into being able to provide the best care to everyone who came in through our doors and I use my experience of working at Jack In The Box and of my schooling and of everything in order to provide the best care and because of that I thrive everywhere I go no matter what position I am placed in I guarantee that I am able to make the most down call positive impact because of all of my experience and instead of focusing just on being a nurse and having that aspect I use my education in order to achieve everything in Care Medical Care Health Care to a person that is sick and come in through some door no we need to provide this experience and education to everyone in the world and the healthcare Optical programming your brand through the internet is more months and its thoughts feelings and actions. And there's a lot of mental health advice that is disseminated through this program but the basic idea of the Nursing degree and the healthcare screen back to be committed to do what the f*** you want to do if you are feeling anxious and you're unsure healing. Normal feeling to have okay you need to stop right talk meditate draw you need to work out. He can't just be how deep down you to push it down for sure but it's not the best way to live because you're not doing what you want to be doing do you really want to be feeling that. You don't talk that the reason why you get that feeling is that discomfort is you knowing that you're not doing weird. What you doing so lenient about this grill the most achieve everything you want to achieve through Massive Action every limitation that there is in life with Ruby time energy space everything can be over, massive Action and the amount of Massive Action that you literally Corley how much you get back and you decide how much action you're going to put but I'm telling you it should be. Do what the f*** you want to do all right next thing when you go over how I came to the realization why I have this mindset and where it comes from next thing is going to be my set with the terms of the people like the retirement and the existential crisis just setting up the structure up before hypermedia course
