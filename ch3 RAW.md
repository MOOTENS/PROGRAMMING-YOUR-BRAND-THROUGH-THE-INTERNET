Arise chapter 3 programming your brand through the internet workload or automated content production now automated Khan production that is the goal we want to be able to have these work clothes the way you do the work we want to be able to create the content produced the concert the video create the audio i'll need to text make a Blog. Put in into creating a piece of concept of itself so by having the work clothes we consistent and if you're able to most effectively use your time energy space and be able to disseminate more information and have time to actually do the word providing the volume up to the room so I'm going to give you an example of a workflow. To give you an example and a structure to build off of so first to create con you have to think about what makes you special in terms of how you create your content if you are a visual person and you prefer to take pictures take video and dr. Reality in that way perfect use that okay go towards that use that as one of your structures to build awesome if you're more of a journal type person you like to text you like to write it out your ideas you like to really make sure that you understand your ideas before you put them out in Block for mornings form if you're that type of journalist then use that okay but that takes work. So when I do them myself when I fertilize my ideas my mind's always going at 1% it's literally always having design ideas everything is going out. And I'm able to redirect all that energy and do what I want to do so when I'm focused and when I'm doing everything that I'm supposed to be doing which the goal is all the time 24/7. The idea of being able to create content and spray. And disseminate my ideas and get my ideas to provide the most value back out into a world podcast is Audio Only typically and you verbalize your ideas you communicate with people you package status audio format and you share. And all people have to do is listen to watch something so podcast for very efficient to consume we can be washing dishes a running doing different activities and you can still be learning in Sinking and to be able to produce. Com share those ideas to verbalize that perspective already work in and of itself so if you are limited by Ayo the recording process the CDN profile process dragging and dropping it onto a computer and then having to put in the folder and then having to go where there's internet and then picking up the title when thinking of a description and then you posted later when you know you're not that you're not going to produce and the stuff that you do produce is going to be so few and far between that knocking it even make a dent in the world of the universe and the internet like literally think of a while then you're not going to get to that point where your search results are just passing the message Matthew because there's so much content being there so much pain I needed you can literally watch a screen watch a wall. Playing all the different content and you'll never be able to consume all the constant ever created so think of what you're competing against that matches the mainstream all that imagine all of that so many buildings and hours of video and years of contact. Daily basis and think of that as your structure of the noise that you have to go through to actually in your ideas and Achieve what you want to achieve the universe through the world give me the internet so I will we think of that automated contact production I think of the podcast so far I use anchor which is an application that connects your one account to Google podcast Apple podcast Stitcher anywhere and everywhere. Disseminated a because the podcast format is so loved the only difference is that then cross-post and use their own service you're already getting cross-posted all these other platforms all these other services like Stitcher and podcast build and all these different services. Your website in Waukee brugos for them that's just a very efficient way so that podcast ended of itself is an efficient format and with the anchor app all you have to do is upload it to one place and everywhere and it's free and it's very easy very simple steps from the time it takes to record and once I'm done recording the podcast I'm able to post the content out the whole world within a minute or two using the most effective search engine optimization using always have bleeding sure I copy paste I use the different tag of the market that I want for diamond and I use the podcast app where I just upload I use a sound recorder I create my recording of my voice and want a high uploaded I share it boom done extra this many pictures of Exodus many contest engagement extra all this extra information and that already is already good but when I go and listen to it and I just go on Google podcast and I can feel it myself and I listened. Grow from that and I reflect and I think it's better when only good can come from it so that's one example of a workflow for like a podcast but another workflow or the right video format workflow when you create a video like on YouTube video be to anywhere you need a title you need a description you need tag your thumbnail Ali. Actual video file to mp4 file so when you think of that making that mp4 file making that video how to get those tags off to my two or else they're not going to reach where you want to meet and then you got to upload it and they going to make sure add all these things to talk about it then you got to do all this work so I think of the title the title is only 100 characters long so we can only be so long that limitation use it and use it with a tube buddy three different sources a resources that you can use for optimizing your posts and depending on the platforms for youth go to tube buddy for YouTube and make a free account and it shows you all of the search engine optimization tag and they show you all of the information I'm literally all I have to do is search how to get more views on YouTube and there's all these resource levels you make sure your tags are these make sure your title description and surrounding make sure no use this thumbnail generator and make sure you're coming up look like you could use that an automatic process the more is not going to seem like work in the more you going to be okay and just do it like working is Roblox going to clean the equipment I really should be doing a program for to do that but I undo it so fast that it would waste time to create a program in front of me just being a few clicks and then cooking for me and then being done with it it will take more time for me to create a program to do so with a video process once I have that MP4 format I automatically start uploading already knows a limitation is the upload speed be a 500ml youTube will only be uploaded at a certain speed and it's going to take like 10 minutes to upload so once I uploaded record intro title the scripture everything all that is included okay video is done you are uploading it now now you're creating the title one of the characters long messages that you want to give your viewers each time you like your website like your shop like your new items like any products you Services your new course is your new contact your new information of you want to talk and paste all that and make sure it's included and then create your own description include links or including any other description that you missed in the video and from there you copy and you just search YouTube. Google you paint that description and you use a tag that he want literally get to 15 and create the most search engine Optimizer constantly could possibly create across the sea everywhere so doesn't matter how search engine optimized your content is if it's not being marketed or it's not be created at the scale I wish it needs to in or just based on the new infection the thing but the value and the energy and all of the other marketing aspects of promoting your ideas all of that is important to but you have to have a good structure and the automated content production is being able to just create don't sit on those files. Make folders and Sue put them in if you really want to you can have the duel things to do but is that going to hold you back and that you're going to be sitting on those files and then they're just sitting there on your computer and you can't. The longer you sit on it the more likely it is that you're going to continue to let it sit there and he's not going to get posted by that time you already grown and you already embarrassed or cream. Who created because he's grown so much. Why would I posted is not me I've grown so much so I think you're going to post these going to post it out there and make that process of treating me so programming your breath to the internet automate.
