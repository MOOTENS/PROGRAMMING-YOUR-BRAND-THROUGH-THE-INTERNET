Alright programming your branch through the internet chapter 7 scalability so scalability going in line with the previous chapters of value efficiency and now scalability bring over the who what when where why how time energy and space in relation to scalability now this is very very big pun intended I guess the scalability aspect is being able to reproduce the function of the program the call to action the selling the value the being able to provide your product Services your idea your values back do the world I'm through your brand. Scalability liability you got the most possible way the owner go will be you getting the equivalent amount of value. Are you in ratio proportionate to how much you give out what does that mean what the f*** is that mean so the more you're able to give out the bigger the two the most amount of people that you're able to provide the value to your brand the more they're going to come that's scalability so be able to reproduce. Set out to as many people to the world being able to provide your product service in value do the world and give it back to you. So scalability who with the people this is what's going to get the presidency to get people on your side little think of the Google the goal is not to get 50% of the people on your side and 50% of the people against your side just because. The Crux. Tree that's name change back to opposing factors literally from its core so it's not going to mix so that's. Going towards. Is not an efficient goal because the scalability of offering. Meet you the most amount of people you have to provide for everyone so you can just appeal to one side or appeal. Now you to everyone his goes back to the bra and example of providing value valley 2-1 Saginaw do you want to be providing value everyone in the world through your value through your product through your services of your brand now scalability. When when scalability scalability should be done when a function when a program when an objectification of an idea of a call to action of a product of a service of that thing once that they can be scaled out. B. And the only way that you're going to be able to learn from the experience and actually grow and adapt because once you scale it it always have to grow it always has to change and it always has to do that or else you're going to stay stagnant is going to die and that's not what a brand does O'Brien continues to innovate and grow and Achieve and overcome and use everything for the most of the advantage when is that scalability ton of providing at Valley call I got service. When is that itch when you find a good function of good work flow and because you're already taking massive action and you're already doing everything now you're always learning every single moment in your life we have the ability to learn and grow and change and we do that literally every single moment we're working we're breathing we are producing more and more so when we think of that idea of scalability is fine. Mentalization that work flow. And then scale it and it make it bigger why scalability the more you give out the more you will receive now when you do more you will get more problems for sure. Definition of Massive Action more problem you want more problem you want to be able to have to pay more tax you want to have to report to the IRS if you want to have lots of fans you want to have lots of them you want to have to have lawyer you want to have all these things right. The light the best way possible I think of Life as a video game think of life like Grand Theft Auto think of life like whatever a Walking Dead type video game where you get to choose your own responses your own reality is your own actions your own your own way of living you're able to do that dizzy this is your world so when you do scalability you're able to scale whatever you want to everywhere and achieve everything you want to achieve the most efficient way possible because you just putting out for lunch and going to come back I'll let me give you an example of scalability in terms of Y if something is worth doing it's worth doing every day if something is worth doing once it's worth doing multiple times Gail Devers for example this housing structure that is the idea of health centers for Successful People is an idea of tiny houses. 100 or more per lot and those tiny houses are connected. And when we do that idea and we work toward that idea. Ability to work doing is were doing lots of places everywhere if it achieve everything we want to achieve there's profit people get Holmes everything works there's Library there's education there's resources there's opportunity there's job through everything so you have to think of scalability in terms of producing the most positive impact for you in terms of the valley that you're providing and the value that you're getting back and scalability is how this next chapter of networking is literally how it gets done because business is done person-to-person business agency to agency because of got coming in and because of. Change. Ability needs to happen through networking so. Shop Your Way life literally communicating doing business continuing God community windows exchanges. That is the word. The value that is the experience that is learn that is how we exchange value. We get to do whatever the f*** we want to do in this life you want to eat do you want to have experiences do you want to create do you want to do whatever the f*** you want to do then do it but you're going to have to get there you have to get help from people to do every everyone has your money your money is someone else's money no one owns money money is someone else's money. The function of money is constantly circulating but you don't really own money your money is someone else's money and it'll keep flowing because the value is being exchanged so when you think of scalability in your brand think of all of that value providing that product. Is it okay if I if I have a thousand people doing this cloud disservice by the million people that idea and it's the representation it's the idea it's the object the actual contraction if the thing it's here it's available it's a perspective and that's scalable so that is one example and it's very efficient with time energy in space because this video format is very efficient in communicating the ideas the feelings actions the programming your brethren because you're hearing it you're watching yet you are reading it you're learning for me you're clicking your interacting you're typing you're doing all the things that are very crucial to help you achieve what you want to achieve and what do you want to achieve that idea that you have in your mind you want to make that real and you want to sell that idea and you want the valley do you want people to agree with that you want people to purchase do you want people to do what you want them to do which is your provider that value obviously it's just you just go hand-in-hand so that is scalability into programming your brand through the internet in terms of time energy space now. Last chapter is networking and this one is crucial what will continue the growth of your company of your business of your the people its life that the whole reason spiritual experience Beasley connect little people do those in motion through those brown who got fell into that exchange of ideas involving so networking is the next chapter
