Alright programming your breath through the internet chapter 5 value now we're going to go over hopefully this is the structure okay the structure is explaining who what when where why how in terms of value and also time energy and space associated with Valium okay now I know I should have a little fast so let me let me repeat that all those W's and that house in the wise all of that related to Value why the value of how the value and then we're going to relate. Find energy in space in terms of value like how much Y and everything and this is just a recap because he's next three chapters including this one value efficiency and scalability it's more philosophical motivational my perspective type because it really is just d it gives you different perspectives of ways of thinking about value to be able to apply it to your life to your brand to sell what you want to sell and to provide the most positive impact through your products through your services through your ideas and dissemination of that so value who value for who is for the people okay now every person every exchange Irish share of energy. Between people especially between brown. Very important so remember it is the people that you are providing value to what what value there's physical value digital download the evaluator stealing value there's electrical valders off of Valley what value are you providing think of how I think of what value you're providing. Washer that limits that just is because of physics because of the world because of the reality of the limitation of the value of what value it is and build off of that exploit. What's the most of your advantage value when when is now okay you need to provide the most value possible now it should be 24/7 all the time but now the present is a present for a reason it's a gift take it it's here consumed it now create value value where value everywhere. Should be going everywhere it should be coming in everywhere should be in taking everywhere and you should be producing value everywhere everywhere in the world in your community and your family in yourself in your pants in your environment in your world Dallas value why now the valley why is very important because when you are providing positive impact positive energy out into the world that is the best way to live I'm speaking again from experience when I provide the most positive value headed to the world the most efficient way possible it's the best reason to live literally it is deep way to live when you just given so much. Back to you and all of that is positive all that's great that's that's a great way to live and the more you do it the more you go the more you grow the more you're able to provide more value the more able to empty that's great so. For the valley house for the value now how for the value as you know is Massive Action Massive Action because there is so much noise in the world you need to provide Massive Action and provide all of those products Services Valley he is everything you just need to provide all of that. Everywhere massively do Massive Action now. Through Pine Valley time should extend beyond this reality you should be able to provide all of those products and services and I'll go. Value from that should be able to be traced in the future and say okay at this point in time because this Valley was produced at this time now in the future as a result we are better for it and thank you for that passed work. Work and energy being done in the past for example making a park for a community because someone a group of people tip. Energy and space at a certain point of time to provide. Then. You will continue to provide. Did energy into the future and. To the energy and the space as well of value the value of energy the limitations that the turn live or only the ones that you place on yourself okay you will only achieve what you want to achieve and any limitation that you place is just a construct of what you place on it is literally it's all how you think about it you can be held down by gravity or you can say it like gravity is helping me but I know the formula I know how to use it I know how to exploit it it just how you think about it so don't think of limitations and all I don't have enough days I don't have enough guide or I have these no think of what you really want to be doing you remind the way again you put that energy out into the world the universe that energy will come back to you when you come in yourself to the universe to universe go back to you so relating. With that energy you have to give that value out you have to give that positive energy out into the world everywhere 24/7 the more you can give it out the more value can provide more energy value energy. I'll be to the world the most efficient way possible no more. Okay and then when you funnel. Do the talk to action do the selling to your product to your service to your customers to your audience to the world you're able to get all of that. All that energy. Dr. Nassif and you're doing it to dual 32033 through all these different ways of getting it efficiently marketing efficiently selling efficiently you're only setting yourself up for Success space what space do you want to give value to your world to your brand how much value do you want to provide out into the world. How much space do you want to dominate braum. Reggie from. How you get back to your bride how much space is should be the most amount of space you should be able to provide a positively out everywhere so this correlates to again if we reach towards this ideal version of who we are these ideas is brand this energy that we put out into the world he will come back to us so if you're hoping to help everyone that you're working toward that then the universe will just finally got back into you through whatever way that you want and if you don't want it if you say I don't deserve it then you're not going to get it but if you want it you're going to f****** get it because again you're going to achieve everything you want to achieve the most efficient way possible cuz you're using everything for the most of your advantage cuz you're committed because you are providing that positive Ally so this is Valley is efficiency or I program your brand to the end
