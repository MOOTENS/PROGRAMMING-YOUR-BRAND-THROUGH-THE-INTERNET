Out into the world so you have to become into it you have to be 100% behind it and the name is very important because again. Structure of them here now let me give you a few examples before we were examples of lutein canon Canon is a camera brand and indignity do lots of other things too but think of that Meme I keep to praying donald Trump he's a brand his person he's a friend Tracy. The person me Jorge Perez I have my own brand you are your own brand to but it's easier to objectify that brand idea into something that you can please and say okay this is the brand it's called X it's called PayPal it's called Google it called production so again the name that you decide for your brand new have to be committed 100% behind it you have to be committed so much that the specific of the spelling the casing has to be specific as well for example Google has their own when you go on google.com be a big G and then small o o g l e Cannon I'm looking at it right now there's a big c and there's a mof muchas production putin is always in capitals if it can be helped if it can be capitalized should be capital okay now sometimes for like usernames or emails it'll automatically reverted back down to lower case but that's fine because that's a limitation but if I'm going to be creating a brand if I'm going to be slapping that brown.

NCAA is those codes on what that is is it structured information that the government has laid out and said okay this is nice as businesses so would you feel if you fall into one of these categories you are a business and it's so broad that whatever you he's going to fit into something whether it be food served a manufacturing advertising marketing whatever it maybe NCAA is code we have to put for is business-to-business electronic Market according to the article nobody to the government in terms of what is Newton's production what does it do what's the description well production is in business-to-business and that means there are electronic systems like the internet that is used to connect businesses with clients and customers and provide different solution based around getting more clients and solving these issues businesses businesses through electronic means so.

All right chapter 1 branding what need is your brand feeling so you have to think about what need am I feeling what is my value that I'm what is the exchange. Through the brand and what happened what what is that Valley what's the need so the need that is most white bread towards your audience is the best knee that you feel so let me let me break that down when you provide a product or a service as a brand dot product and service the people that got prom services for that Exchange. That's your audience now. About what value you giving back to your audience and by that returns you're going to get value back through money through Fame through like through understanding of your ideas to dissemination of your ideas to talking about your brand to all of that. Just getting back from your audience but what value are you giving me the most important thing that you can possibly do is provide positive impact. So the most positive impact you can give back out to the world is education is your perspective is your story because people learn from other people's stories. Like that's what gossip is that's what learning about different people is we learn from other people's stories and that's $30 you can learn from me and what is that that's education not giving the store getting the valley. Providing back so people don't buy a brand just because it looks cool or it's something it's because they get a special feeling of connection when people buy a Nike shirt and they pay twenty five they're not just doing it because it looks cool it's because they have that connection to have that feeling they feel that connection with that brand and they know that feeling chords feeling good because they like that brown shoes they like the marketing they like the message behind it they have that feeling so they can sit and that's dance from the value that they're providing the audience for your brand nothing about that all of the people in the world every all of that value product the services. Is offering those products and services and value have to be to the most of the advantage of everyone in the world everyone have to improve because of the valley that you're providing structure to build your brand off of let me give you an example of your audience beat ever and whatever your brand being to provide the value and products and services. Let me give you a scenario an example of a bra company okay now a bra company is maybe focus on women and they want to just tell them that market so that I am an older people younger there they're not really our audiences just emails between this ages and I can afford these luxury bras. Brandon service is offering a service and it goes to an audience but if that brand stays that way and hold those limitations on to themselves are not going to succeed because they're not providing. Out to everyone now just a little restructuring of the way the message is portrayed and it makes all the difference now imagine that bran if you aren't you don't fit in that audience that you don't really have that connection you don't have emotion attached to it you don't know you don't really care about that Broad Run even if you use it is like I asked if the thing is is a thing Ron Brown high end bras for a specific meal bracket of pay that is Lucas higher because the tire quality that is that are for females obviously because they are so high quality the bras prevent back pain from the women that wear in the Bronx and front that you can not only be used as sex Enos and as something to feel good ways and spend a little bit extra on something special something that is literally used to you got structure for your body to prevent back medical device and really really need a can also be used by anyone to have and little boys little girls growing up you don't sharing. Educate what are breasts are breast cancer about the back pain about the puberty about everything it's just the men the women the husband's the why is everyone has been improved because the bad things that are go away everyone's going to feel free from having that good high quality and there's also. I go out and provided so we imagine imagine that Imagine That Brand now compared to the brand that is just limited by their own Thinking by their own presentation is Miles Away you want that other bra brand to succeed even if you don't wear bras even if you have even if you have no connection you're never going to buy it you're never going to see it you still want that Francis succeed because of all of that positive impact of providing out into the world so. That your brand is feeling like you have to think of how does it apply to everyone in the world go towards that really if you work towards making what you do with the products and services, you create everyone in the world and you work towards down to 100% you were down to cheer overcome and continue to go. Providing the most positive impact on the world through your brand imagine where you are going to go alright imagine everything to succeed and imagine how you're going to feel while you're in that grind while you're in that world in that work in. In. So you're creating imagine how you're going to feel and now watching the Bulls that you're going to cheat imagine all of those goals are going to continue to achieve and produce and network and connect with the frame of thinking of all you have to do so think of the knee that you're feeling think of it. Apply to everyone in the world so Brandy your approach and it goes back to the master. As I figure if you're still listening to this and you haven't automatically tune. Map of Golden Master.
