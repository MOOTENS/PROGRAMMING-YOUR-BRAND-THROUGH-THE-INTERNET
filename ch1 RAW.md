Chapter 1 

Programming your brand through the internet

Branding


This subsection is 

NAME


What is the name of your brand?

The name is very important.

If it means something to you and whatever the name is that you create, as long as you commit to that 100%.

Full force.

Doesn't matter what the f*** it is. 

It can be numbers, exlamation points, whatever. 

But generally, you want to think of 

BIG

BIG

BIG 

brand as the brand that you're creating. 

Not only do you think of the brand in terms of your knitting business, your consultation business, your little plant business.

Whatever business/ brand   you have, think of it in terms of big, MASSIVE things.

Legal.

Government.

Everything related to that.

When you have your brand name, you're going to have to disseminate that brand name out into the world.

You have to be committed to it.

You have to be 100% behind it.

The name is very important because that's going to be the amin structure of that idea.

Let me give you a few examples before we move onto the examples of MOOTENS productions. 

Canon.

Canon is a camera brand.

They do lots of other things too, but think of that name.

That's a brand name.

Nike. 

Supreme.

Donald trump.

He's a brand. 

His person, he's a brand. 

Tracie Dang.

She's a brand, she's a person. 

Me, George Perez, I am own brand.

You are your own brand, too.

It's easier to objectify that brand idea into something that you can place and say "Okay, this is the brand."

It's called X. 

It's called PayPal.

It's called Google.

It's called MOOTENS productions.

The name that you decide for your brand, you have to be committed 100% behind it.

You have to be committed so much that the specific of the spelling, the casing has to be specific as well.

For example, Google has their own specifics. 

When you go on google.com, you can see the big G and then small o o g l e.

Cannon, I'm looking at it right now.

There's a big C and there's a n o n.

There's not two n's or a small C.

It's all consistent. 

Mootens Productions.

MOOTENS is always in capitals.

If it can be capitalized, it SHOULD be capital.

Sometimes, for usernames or emails it'll automatically revert it back down to lower case.

But that's fine because that's that limitation.

If I'm going to be creating a brand, if I'm going to be slapping that brand onto something, it's going to be all capital.

That's just how it is.

That's just how the idea of the brand name is- it's always in capitals. 

Even in government documents.

For the LLC.

For the bank statements.

Everything.

It's all capitals- MOOTENS. 

And productions is all in lower case. 

There's no capital P in productions. 

It is all lower case.

As soon as it got the LLC attached to it, it's the big L the big L and the big C.

There's no lowercase.

It's MOOTENS in all capital.

Productions in all lowercase.

And LLC without periods, and in capital.  

Think of your brand.

Write that s*** down if you have not yet.

Please.

You need to write it down and you need to multiply that.

You need to keep writing it down.

You need to keep typing it out.

You need to keep saying it.

You need to be consistent and 100% with your brand name.

You know what it is, so make that out into the world. 

The second thing is the DESCRIPTION.

The description of your brand, what is your brand?

What is your mission statement? 

What is your despcription? 

This is needed in every social media site.

You have your bio, you have your description.

Even when you create it as a full-fledged business that is connected with the government.

Your documentation that you provide, the description- what is it?

MOOTENS productions started with "improvement through hypermedia" because that is what it is.

It's the productions that is created through MOOTENSand its improvement through hypermedia.

Literally in that sense, you can see the improvement through the hypermedia.

The hypermedia is just the combination of 

Audio 

Images 

Video 

Text

that is embedded in the internet technology through the web, and disseminated.

That's hypermedia. 

But "improvement through hypermedia" as a description- the government doesn't recognize that.

It's like okay, what do you do?

In MOOTENS productions, we do improvement through hypermedia.

Well, what is that?

When you think of the future-proofing of whatever your brand is going to be, maybe you're thinking "I'm never going to do the official LLC or make it into a corporation or make it recognized by the government."

You SHOULD be working towards because again, those MASSIVE goals.

You're going to be getting so much income that it's going to be illegal to not do it. 

Eventually you'll have to do it, so still think of it.

What value are you providing? 

What do you want people to think of when they think of the brand? 

When people think of MOOTENS productions, they think "improvement through hypermedia."

Going back to the government aspect: the description of your brand. 
If you look up NCAIS, it’s some classification of what your brand really is. 
When you’re in the hypermedia course, you can just click and there will be different examples. 
Those examples, that code NCAIS is structured information that the government has laid out and said, this is what we recognize as businesses. 
If you fall into one of these categories, you are a business.
It’s so broad that whatever you do is GOING TO fit into something. 
Whether it be food service, manufacturing, advertising, marketing, whatever it may be. 
The best NCAIS code that we put for MOOTENS productions is business to business electronic markets. 
That is the official classification, according to our documentation that we provided to the government, in terms of what is MOOTENS productions. 
What does it do? 
What is the description? 
MOOTENS production is in business to business electronic markets. 
That means there are electronic systems, like the internet, that are used to connect businesses with clients and customers and provide different solutions based around getting more clients and solving these issues through electronic means. 
That falls under the new description of MOOTENS productions LLC, which is not only improvement through hypermedia. 
That’s become secondary. 
Now, it is business to business electronic marketing solutions. 
When we think of where we’re at with our branding, our name, and our description, it’s: 
MOOTENS productions LLC business to business electronic marketing solutions. 
There’s also a SUBSECTION: improvement through hypermedia, which is all the unique values and perspectives that make the brand unique. 
After that, in terms of branding, you need STYLING. 
The styling is 
The color
The way your brand logo looks
And the colors that your brand is. 
Usually, people will have a rectangular logo and a square logo. 
Usually the square logo is used for a simple avatar, image, or logo that says, “we worked with this company.”
I’m sure you know lots of different examples of logos in square form.
Also, your name is a logo in and of itself. 
Whatever your name is, that is a logo. 
The more you mix and match, create, and add onto it, that’s still your logo. 
That is your name.
That’s the rectangular aspect of it. 
The MOOTENS logo is art. 
I made MOOTENS, but within the letters is different images and different stickers that make up the words. 
That’s it- that’s the brand. 
That is the uniqueness of the name- it is its own brand. 
You should be able to put your brand name on a sticker, make it unique and say, 
“Look at this- this is my f****** brand right here!”
You are able to do that. 
The factors that make it unique and consistent is specifically the font and colors. 
Go ah

All right chapter 1 branding what need is your brand feeling so you have to think about what need am I feeling what is my value that I'm what is the exchange. Through the brand and what happened what what is that Valley what's the need so the need that is most white bread towards your audience is the best knee that you feel so let me let me break that down when you provide a product or a service as a brand dot product and service the people that got prom services for that Exchange. That's your audience now. About what value you giving back to your audience and by that returns you're going to get value back through money through Fame through like through understanding of your ideas to dissemination of your ideas to talking about your brand to all of that. Just getting back from your audience but what value are you giving me the most important thing that you can possibly do is provide positive impact. So the most positive impact you can give back out to the world is education is your perspective is your story because people learn from other people's stories. Like that's what gossip is that's what learning about different people is we learn from other people's stories and that's $30 you can learn from me and what is that that's education not giving the store getting the valley. Providing back so people don't buy a brand just because it looks cool or it's something it's because they get a special feeling of connection when people buy a Nike shirt and they pay twenty five they're not just doing it because it looks cool it's because they have that connection to have that feeling they feel that connection with that brand and they know that feeling chords feeling good because they like that brown shoes they like the marketing they like the message behind it they have that feeling so they can sit and that's dance from the value that they're providing the audience for your brand nothing about that all of the people in the world every all of that value product the services. Is offering those products and services and value have to be to the most of the advantage of everyone in the world everyone have to improve because of the valley that you're providing structure to build your brand off of let me give you an example of your audience beat ever and whatever your brand being to provide the value and products and services. Let me give you a scenario an example of a bra company okay now a bra company is maybe focus on women and they want to just tell them that market so that I am an older people younger there they're not really our audiences just emails between this ages and I can afford these luxury bras. Brandon service is offering a service and it goes to an audience but if that brand stays that way and hold those limitations on to themselves are not going to succeed because they're not providing. Out to everyone now just a little restructuring of the way the message is portrayed and it makes all the difference now imagine that bran if you aren't you don't fit in that audience that you don't really have that connection you don't have emotion attached to it you don't know you don't really care about that Broad Run even if you use it is like I asked if the thing is is a thing Ron Brown high end bras for a specific meal bracket of pay that is Lucas higher because the tire quality that is that are for females obviously because they are so high quality the bras prevent back pain from the women that wear in the Bronx and front that you can not only be used as sex Enos and as something to feel good ways and spend a little bit extra on something special something that is literally used to you got structure for your body to prevent back medical device and really really need a can also be used by anyone to have and little boys little girls growing up you don't sharing. Educate what are breasts are breast cancer about the back pain about the puberty about everything it's just the men the women the husband's the why is everyone has been improved because the bad things that are go away everyone's going to feel free from having that good high quality and there's also. I go out and provided so we imagine imagine that Imagine That Brand now compared to the brand that is just limited by their own Thinking by their own presentation is Miles Away you want that other bra brand to succeed even if you don't wear bras even if you have even if you have no connection you're never going to buy it you're never going to see it you still want that Francis succeed because of all of that positive impact of providing out into the world so. That your brand is feeling like you have to think of how does it apply to everyone in the world go towards that really if you work towards making what you do with the products and services, you create everyone in the world and you work towards down to 100% you were down to cheer overcome and continue to go. Providing the most positive impact on the world through your brand imagine where you are going to go alright imagine everything to succeed and imagine how you're going to feel while you're in that grind while you're in that world in that work in. In. So you're creating imagine how you're going to feel and now watching the Bulls that you're going to cheat imagine all of those goals are going to continue to achieve and produce and network and connect with the frame of thinking of all you have to do so think of the knee that you're feeling think of it. Apply to everyone in the world so Brandy your approach and it goes back to the master. As I figure if you're still listening to this and you haven't automatically tune. Map of Golden Master. Be obsessed and fee averaged is not good hit if you have already turned off that you're listening so let's talk about the approach now that everything has to be kind by a million I'm telling you everything has to be massive if you really want your grand to succeed it needs to be massive he needs to be doing for 4 super snacks with your time your energy and your space everything kind energy in space and Massive Action okay the more you control your thoughts feelings and actions the more you write it out the more you talk it out the more you meditate the more you reflect the more you are caught can understand that control your thoughts being an action the better you are able to achieve everything you want but you not only with your ground but with yourself and that is what makes up the approach the approach should be massive as well as the goals as well as the value for your providing now on the last chapters of this program nearest Value efficiency and scalability with the most deficiency and they scared the s*** out of it Skillet put it in an object and just multiply exponentially at that gif created make a good function make a good program making something good that works and just multiply that change it affected and just grow that and disseminate.
