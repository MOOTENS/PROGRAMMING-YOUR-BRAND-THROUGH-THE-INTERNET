What's up! 

Programming Your Brand Through The Internet 

Chapter 0: Why 

I want to start by introducing myself.

My name is George Perez.

I am the President of MOOTENS productions.

The business is dual run with my wife Tracie Dang-Perez (CEO).

We started with MOOTENS productions in 2015.

There was a need to be filled where I wanted to make a cute gift for my wife during Christmas .

I didn't have any money.

I wanted to make something meaningful.

Instead of doing an alternative:

I put all of my:

Time 

Energy 

and Space 

Into creating a cute little logo of half of our cats faces Moo and Mittens : MOOTENS.

We combine the faces together and 

We get MOOTENS productions.

The "productions" incorporates the background of hypermedia graphic design including audio, video, images, combined with programming through web technology to improve the transfer of ideas, experiences, and communication between people.

From here I'm going to go for a little bit about what the structure of how we got here.

This is going to be very important along the journey and along the story of explaining why we are here.

We grew up in Southern California. 

I was born on August 4th 1992. 

Tracie was born 1993. 

We met High School 2010 and married 2018.

My parents were born in Mexico and are American citizens now. 

We grew up and moving around to different houses and cities.

Every moment of my life we were taught 

Go to school 

Do your hundred percent 

Work Hard 

And hopefully one day on the house 

have a family and be successful 

Bbe able to do what we want to do .

as we grow up in life we realize that (most) everything that Society teaches us 

In terms of 

education,

What is success 

What is life 

What is work 

What is money 

All of that just starts to fall apart when we actually live our lives 

Understand what life really is. 

this program is a not only a book in terms of a textbook and ebook

It's also a video series, audiobook.

Everything combined with images, links, tools, resources, and interactable sections.

This makes the Hypermedia Course.

Thank you for making the investment in continuing to grow and live your best life.

Then thank you for sharing our energy. 

You are powerful.

We learn and grow together. 

When you are better I am better.

Chapter 0: Family History

The history of my Father's side:

My Dad's name is Jose de Jesus Perez. 

He grew up in a small farm town Apozol, Guadalajara, Mexico.

We have a family story of being able to own a radio.

We were one of the first families to own a radio in the village.

Batteries were a commodity. 

They had to take out the big D batteries and put them out of the sun and that would recharge them enough to have the radio play the local stations.


My dad left Mexico when he was 15 he was helping with the farm and at 15 he had the opportunity to go to the United States.

 For opportunities, for jobs.
 
 It was a new world to him, but we .
 
 My grandpa had worked on the U.S. Railroad and there's a lot of history beyond that.
 

 My dad came, he worked, he met my mom.
 
 
 They were childhood friends in terms of the village that they grew up in and it was small.
 

I am not surprised they are together.
 
They worked their asses off and they showed us what hard work really is.
 
 
More emphasis on my mom's story:

She grew with my two sisters and my grandma.

Three sisters and one mom.

Our Grandpa was not a very good provider 

So he decided excited to live the life that he lived and he suffered greatly for it 

Because he suffered later on in his life 

to have a good life of what he wanted 

to live without our family without his daughters without his wife 

then ultimately my mom's side of the family suffered and 

 my grandpa ultimately sufffered at his end of life 

so because my grandpa was not a part of our family 

my grandma and my mom and aunts have to provide for themselves 

my grandma has this store rest in peace 

she needed to make money 

so she would make Jello for the neighborhood 

shooting make big batches of Jell-O which she wouldn't sell to 

 some local people who would then take that Jello break it up 

and then sell it and self profit 

and then my mom aunts and what all food do seamstress seen in. 

Type cloth type of work as well as having a different jobs 

they also built their house from the ground up all by themselves 

that entrepreneurial ship type of drive

 for sure is a big part of what makes me me 

 my mom and her experience reality \ 

combined with my dad's hard work ethic 

have made me who I am so 

I am nothing but proud of where I come from 

and the Legacy. I'm Leaving On To The Future Generations so 


thank you
 


 When I think of the impact that my parents had on me and the main things are:
 
 Working your ass off.
 
 Working fucking hard.
 
 Working at 100%
 
 I thank you because I am who I am because of you.
 
 The idea of where we come from and everything that we've gone through is nothing compared to what our parents had to go through.
 
 
 The idea of this life, of having children, of continuing your seed and your genetics:
 
 We want to make our lives "easier" for us.
 
 "Easier".
 
 We also want to make it "Easier" for our kids.
 

 "Easier" really means:
 

 More opportunities.
 
 More education.
 
 More tools.
 
 More resources.
 
 To be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
 
 The "typical" way is schooling and academics.
  
 We go to school.
 
 we get our education.
  
 We get our degree, our GPA.
 
 We get a job based on that degree.
 
 We save up money to buy a house and everything.
 
 Some for sure are following along in those paths and in that journey, but:
 
 That is not "THE" correct path because when we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 When we are held down by these limitations of:
 
 "Work".
 
 We feel like we're "busy".
 
 Or feel like we're tired.
 
 That means we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 So if you are doing what you want to be doing then you're going to have lots of time, energy, and have the space to actually do it.
 
 The other key to this is you have to be obsessed with what you want to do.

 AND DO IT.
 
 If you are obsessed and if you are committed with what you want to achieve and you do everything that you want to do at 100%
 
 What's going to be the result?
 
 You're going to fucking achieve everything you want to achieve!
 
 You have to keep working on it and you only stop when you die. 

Your legacy lives on for as long as you want it to continue after you are physically gone from this reality.
 
 Retirement is a myth!
 
 You are going to continue to work.
 
 Continue to live your best life until the moment that you die.
 
 This idea that you work, work, work and then all of a sudden we just stop 

This is not the right idea.
 
You work and then all the sudden you just stop. 

It's not the right idea.

Every single moment. 

In this reality 

You are working.

Every time you breathe.

Work is constantly being done.

Even if you do nothing.

Doing nothing i a lot of work .

A lot of Fucking work 

Let's go ahead and do what the FUCK we want to do. 


Thank our parents 

Thank our family 

Thank our connection t 

Thank ancestors 

Think our lineage 

We would not be here without the help of them.

It's our job to continue.

Continue to provide the best possible life.

For everyone. 

Not only our kids but our children from the earth.

Everyone.

Even if they're strangers. 

We are all neighbors in this earth.

If you are doing your best, we are on the correct team. 

We need to do our best,

Automatically everyone in the world improves.

Thank you for doing your best 

When I'm better you're better 

When you're better I'm better

We're going to continue on with "Programming Your Brand Through The Internet"

We are going to go over the schooling and academic aspect of this program.

Just so you have the information about me and where all of this is coming from.

There is a certain approach of how to view "problems".

Depending on your education and 

And the experiences that you have.

There are different ways of approaching life. 

I'm going to show you my background 

So you have deeper perspective.

What helped me and some ways that can really help you.

Overall because we are here right now in this very moment, 

Everything that happened was exactly the way it was supposed to happen.

Chapter 0: Why 

Academics 


Tracie and I grew up in Southern California. 

We graduated from Henry J. Kaiser High School in Fontana, California.

We graduated at the top of our classes. 

I have always been a bright and energetic child.

I read at a high reading level my whole life.

Our parents pushed us into mastering our academics. 

I skipped first grade because my home schooling in my first years of life put me in the advanced tier of second grade when I "should" have been in first grade.

I was held back by public school administrators after finishing second grade. 

I had straight A's but administration sold the idea I was too "small" and would get bullied by the other students. 

I remember having to memorize all multiplication tables past 13 by the time I was in second grade. 

I received a mix of education in Southern California Schools and a Mexican Elementary Government School, 

Mexico schooling was only temporary: my dad injured his back and we lost our house in Compton, California. 


The local kids would throw rocks at me and discriminate because I had an "American" accent. 

The lunch ladies would not give me the ~$0.20 lunch of bean soup because we were "American" and we could afford to pay more. 

All chaos that happened in our life gets dealt with quickly because we take no shit from anyone. 




I always succeeded in school. 

My parents taught me to drive stick shift when I was 9 years old. 

I was introduced to photoshop and the internet that age as well by my architect cousin Peter.


As a child, I pictured myself typing away at a computer in the tallest skyscraper in the biggest city. 

That was the idea of success I was working towards.

2008 happened, everything since then was to find stability. 

The possibility of "just" surviving as an American was the target we were told to reach towards. 

I decided I wanted to be a registered nurse when I was 16 because I knew the education would give me the structure to accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish. 

I went to Riverside Community College with the goal to become a Licensed Registered Nurse.


California State University Sacramento is where I got my Bachelors Of Science in Nursing (BSN).


I am a Registered Nurse with extensive experience in Primary Care, Triaging, Urgent Care, Substance Abuse, Behavioral Health, and Motivational Interviewing. 


After graduation December 2015, I used all my skills , time, energy, and space to make design of our fur babies:

Moo and Mittens. 

I took a picture of them straight on, cartoonized their faces in photoshop, split the images down the middle, combined, and that is how the idea of MOOTENS was created. 


When I would express my ideas through digital art, I would share these works to the world through the internet. 

I know when I put my full force and energy into creating something, it is always better it is created than not. 

When I would make accounts or have to place a "logo" I would use the the MOOTENS name and use our same logo. 

As time went on, this idea of MOOTENS kept coming back. 

Now, MOOTENS productions is a full fledged business focused on bringing together people using electronic marketing solutions in advertisement, hypermedia graphic design, and workflow optimization. 

We use our experiences in 

Business, 

Art, 

Technology, 

and Healthcare,

In order to improve, grow, achieve, and overcome all challenges that come in life.

I know the American Public Education System.

The public school game is mainly memorization. 

Shut up, sit down, and if you have anything to say you have to ask permission to speak and get granted the ability to grow.

Read this part of the textbook answer these questions.

You're getting tested based on memorization.

University education is very similar to the public K-12 school system. 

Also lots of memorization, but you have to apply those understood ideas along with skills and communication to provide the best care.


Memorization is the lowest form of education. 

I realize now: 


The best way to go through life is to put our full force and energy into achieving everything we want to achieve. 

The better we are able to focus our 

Thoughts, 

Feelings, 

and Actions, 

the better we are able to work towards living our ideal lives.

All of our experience teaches us who the FUCK we are. 

What we are working towards. 

The future. 

Everything we have learned makes us who we are.

I used to want to compartmentalize my life into limitations. 

"I only do this, or I'm only that".

In reality, all of our experiences make us who we are. 

All of our perspective makes up the value that we provide back out to the world. 

The reason why I'm bringing this up in this Hypermedia Course of Programming Your Brand Through The Internet:

You don't need formal education.

You do not "NEED" licenses or certifications. 

If we learn, change, grow, and use technology to the most of our advantage,  

Literally we can create whatever the fuck we want to create.

If we just put our hundred percent full force, Time, Energy, and Space we will accomplish everything.

Instead of: 

Being Average. 

Spinning our wheels.

Being Tired. 

Stop. 

We learn best from other people's stories. 

Learn from different people.

Do everything with massive action and experiment always.

I'm going to give you the guidelines that all of the other successful brands, companies, and agencies use to succeed.

We're using those the industry-standard guidelines as a launching point to start off our journey.


We're going to be growing our brand and where

We're going to be disseminating our ideas and information into the whole world and

This structure is through MOOTENS production and 

the whole guideline everything is compartmentalize into this program.

We use all of our skills to be able to provide the best solutions to everyone.

I thrive everywhere I go.

No matter what position I am placed in,

I guarantee that I am able to make the most positive impact because of all of my experience 

--- 

Thoughts Feelings and Actions. 

There's a lot of mental health advice that is disseminated throughout this program.

The basic idea of living our best lives:

To be committed

To do what the FUCK we want to do.

If we are feeling anxious and you're unsure healing. 

It is not normal feeling to have. 


We need DO MORE.

Write.

Talk.

Meditate

Draw

you need to work out.

He can't just be how deep down

We can push that negativity down for sure but it's not the best way to live. 

Because you're not doing what you want to be doing.

Do you really want to be feeling that? 

NO.

The only reason we get that bad feeling 

Is knowing we are not doing what we're supposed to be doing.

We know what the fuck we need to do. 


Lean into that discomfort

Grow the most, and achieve everything we want to acheive.

Achieve through Massive Action .

Every limitation that there is in life is our own box we place ourselves in. 

The answer is always massive Action. 

The amount of Massive Action that we intake and output through this world,

Is literally correlated to how much value we get back.

We decide how much action we put out.

I'm telling you how it should be. 

Do what the FUCK we want to do.

All right we're to go over some real s*** right now we are going over programming your brand through the internet chapter 0 Y and now we're going on to be existential crisis moment. Realized what the f*** do I need to be doing so this realization if HIPAA need this thing. I feel like everyone has this moment and everyone has these moments where they can look back and they can say okay this thing that happened it happened this way and now I'm here because of that but what does that mean what does that mean in order to change there needs to be a spark within spark that's how it starts and then the fire goes and then eventually. Inferno and. Got your stool that's your spirit that's your energy. F*** you want to be doing so. Markdown talking about is the spark that pushed me into realizing what do I want to be doing what's like what is this what is this world what are we doing so how I got there is my whole life my whole life I wanted to be successful to have a house to have a wife have a family provides the most impact be positive live that good life but really I was so caught up so, and with achieving what I thought I need to achieve which was. Education. Job the getting a new car and moving in with the girlfriend now why and having that stable job having that ink having. $3 an hour $40 I started with $31 power and I moved in with Tracy we have an apartment we had our cats and but you don't want to achieve I was a nurse I got a job now I had a car I don't have to worry about it breaking down now we're thinking about buying a house to this life is is not good is not good because there's no growth that was happening during that time Tracy was growing she was doing her modeling she was taking time and energy and space to build program to build herself to developer skills hobbies and interests and I I cheated you want to achieve I got my license I got my degree I did everything eventually maybe I would become a provider a nurse practitioner and something else but... Part of what I really wanted to be doing because I work my whole life to achieve what I wanted to achieve which was to become a nurse and registered nurse and now that it was here now what I said that's it no that's not it so we push forward we got our house we moved in we got everything set up exactly how we wanted to set it up we tore down the wall we renovated the kitchen the bathroom and I have my computer I have my objects my things we would go to restaurant we were not really worrying about money that's life I do know how to cope because I would do a hundred percent at work but when I would do so much of my hundred percent at work I would have to come home and be exhausted I think I would have to come home and be exhausted that was the Trap. That I had put myself I put those limitation onto my life they work hundred percent go to work and then come home and do nothing yeah I work so hard all day that I die go to do nothing and just enjoy life and be comfortable and decided but I know that. Not the back way to live because you're not growing you're not changing Bridget stag and that is not a good way to live so how would I cope well 8 to 5 is Monday through Friday. Work schedule I would come home 5 p.m. Turn off my clothes put on my home clothes make something to eat turn on the projector go on YouTube and Just auto play all day just YouTube video after video after video after video and not healthy not healthy at all why I come home and I just plot in front of the couch and I just get all of the con all these videos on the sound is it numb me out while I just push everything else. At Pinewood progressed I would start getting anxiety underlying anxiety this feeling. Do you that would grow more and more and more and more and more I would not grow just like you do something good and something else could happen they something else good and something more positive comes to you as well I do nothing I do nothing at home. So the existential moment. Was that I Came Upon it was around 1 or 2 a.m. I was watching a bunch of YouTube videos on auto-play and call the next video. I'm about to play was about Bitcoin and for some reason or another I had the YouTube I saw the recommended videos and then the auto until you see what the next video. And for the past seven eight hours. The projector whirring overhead I did not even touch the keyboard because I would just let the YouTube algorithm feed me whatever I want going to feed me and I went down this rabbit hole news bloopers then. And then. Just other information and then it the YouTube algorithm got to a point recommend me a video about Bitcoin and something inside of me something decided to know I don't watch that let me go to the next one I have to stop and think what am I doing i'm literally the moment where I decided I don't want to watch this and I took that action II I found myself on my way over way what am I doing why at this moment why am I so averse to going down this path and I realize now that that was the discomfort I did not want to watch you because it was something new something that I have been pushing down and that pushing down was a Bitcoin is the money I read about it in 2010/2011 sometime I don't have to watch it and just that. Just because I know what it is I don't want to watch it why am I so averse to watching this I remember this moment specifically because this was one of my existential crisis moments where I realized my actions and I watched that video and I just got this feeling of Goosebumps it was just this feeling. I was just watching over me I had no f****** idea what they Quinn was what it really mad for the future was going or what it really was and I watch. I forced myself to watch. And I realized I have no idea what the f*** this is and the more I started doing research into it the more I realized oh my God this and future I thought I knew what it was and here is the answer as to what is money what is line what is job what is this reality is world what are we doing what are we working towards money cardi of money put that what is that like just that moment like we're waiting for. So you can buy a projector so you can consume contact when I went down that rabbit-hole I open them my eyes really asked to what is this reality what is this world this Earth these nations in governments this money this form of control what is this what is this instead of going to work on your bass coming consuming content being entertained getting my bread and circuses eating fast food spending money working through a hundred percent being stressed not coping not growing. Do you want to be doing and from that moment on this was around February 2018 I'm late February I just turn my life around again my light turned around from that spark from that moment that I have to look back into my life and think what the f*** what is this what is money what is this like what am I working toward what are we working toward what is this what does it mean to be a human we're all Spiritual Beings having a human experience I realize that now but like what we doing so the moment. You we have that spark. Stop going you can either. And make that go away turn it down even more or you can feed into it you can feed it if you can be like that what is that I don't do what I'm supposed to be doing so whatever that moment is for you you have to decide you have to make it real you can't just only has kind of that thing that kind of over there no you have to be able to explain it because that makes you who you are the better you are able to verbalize your thoughts feelings the better you're able to control them and then the bed rate while you're able to achieve everything you want to achieve so that was my little existential moment story others definitely more Tiffany moments draw that I had and I'm going to continue to have but that is one of the main reasons why I am here today from that spark that broke me out of that Loop of give me the consumer and just being a hard worker and not doing what I want to be doing so now I'm going to talk about the programming idea my education my background and a self-taught developer a programmer and I've only been programming or around the year and I am already at that level where I'm able to cheat everything I want to achieve using all of the Technologies which is HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the building block the internet and that's literally what's needed to program for brown through the internet even if you don't know specifically as long as you know the details of what it is and what it does and then you're able to just out sort all those things that you don't want to do or that you are able to do what you want to do using the building block I showed you hear through rocket internet program

All right chapter 0 why programming so the goal of programming really is to put those ideas that you have in your head and make them real through a computer when you make it real to a computer then you're able to digitize that idea and spread it to everyone in the world to the Internet so I'm that idea programming what what do you mean by idea literally if you write your things and you submitted I'm not easy form of programming really HTML is a programming language it's the structure of the internet so if you're able to build HTML code if you would make a Blog to make your own website you're f****** program where there's literally people that enjoy the WordPress learn how to drag and drop images and use templates to make website front-end web developer they're on the lower Dam because they don't really know the backend stuff they just know how to make the website look pretty and two connecting but really what do you want to be doing do you learn algorithms to be able to sort. Data to work for Google to connect all these people to the internet through them and I used to think the idea of programming was to go on the computer type out some stuff and create some programs and people use them and somehow you get paid for it companies will pay you to program their website or Dare program their back something along those lines maybe something with computers like building computers building Hardware or making games or something like that but yes you can literally do what the f*** you want to do literally do anything and everything you can possibly think of and there's this meme. I said I wish I learned I wish I knew how to program and then someone grabs their hand they stick a pen and then they put it on paper and ink they start programming and then idea is again putting those ideas that and digitizing them in a way that the computer can make sense of those ideas so as as we get more deep programming your Bronco The Intern it basically the specifics but again cuz all these tools and resources that you if you don't want to take that time and energy and space into learning those skills yourself more you're into this the more you grow into this the more come in terms of your experience and your education because you'll learn what you want to learn full of all of this information technology courses I'm thinking we want to be doing but I started around the year ago from today late 2018 I knew that I needed to be doing something else other than just watching YouTube and I'm coming home and having an underlying anxiety and that lack of growth and stagnation would I'm going towards other areas of life so that was not good and I need you to do something so when I got into Bitcoin I realized okay this is the future this is any internet starting right now we are in the moments of the initial part of the cryptocurrency movement and I want to get in on this because it's something that I'm passionate about I'm at I want to do and I thought that thing was a big nice to feel in the cryptocurrency community in terms of content and new engagement and everything so I signed up for steam it. Reddit you post blogs and when people up boat you you get cryptocurrency and I went into this all right I want to be doing some photoshop I want to do videos I want to engagement Community I want to be a part of his coming in put myself out there and give Donald Trump. But also receive a lie back as well from all of the work that I put in and just starting out I made a YouTube account and then I probably did that for a few months before I realized okay and it's this Khan it wasn't working because I would just go to work and I'll do my nursing job and then I'll come home and not really engage fully maybe I'll do a video about spend the day doing a video that I posted by the end of the night and then I would have really follow up and then I would make like a video a week and then a video a day and then I will delve into all these different ideas of social media and content but it wasn't really working out so I realized all right what do I really want to be doing as well so I decided I'm around a year ago around September 2018 to Starling program so what did I do how to program best programming language to learn python python is a high-level program stop literally you're able to do anything and everything you can possibly think of what the program and why would you can do that with python and I did I was I was committed I knew that. I need to learn to program and python was one of the best auctions so I went into it I downloaded my resources my but I followed the chapters I was going along with it but I went to like 15 chapters in the first week and I realized that nothing was sticking and I force myself through it to learn it to get like the basics of it but I got to a point where I could literally make anything and everything. Wanted to make and then I had to step back and think what what I want to do and eventually the idea connected with everything that I was working on like the half moon half maintains the moontones the music that I was making the little art project I was doing I would just put as the structure so if I made a image if I was wanting to develop my skills and Photoshop and just mess around and creates an image has helped slap a move him down there whenever they would be I would make a song to Fruity Loops FL Studio and I was messing around with. Software do you want to learn it what's the artist and the song on same thing with video on video with the channel. So that idea of creating content putting it out there branding you. And in the programming what's the variable name what program do I want to create what's the folder with the repository name or this variable name will be called in it and its variable name we called move and everything combined eventually into what it is today which is everything combined all the hobbies and interests. Audio images video programming on spreading ideas understanding our feelings on doing big things and actually living our best lives everything let's of that and the eventuality of where we got to where we're at with the programming is I would delve into the front-end web. Which is how it looks visually the button do you click and everything and I decided to go a separate route from the typical cord like if you learn programming and you go to bootcamp and you develop your skills to work as a developer in Silicon Valley in the Bay Area then you're going to learn always bloated as Frameworks like react and other Frameworks that like PHP built from all the programming language is the great but the problem with the framework is that they're built so high and so bloated that just even start programming the specific language have to go to mom's death and release come down and being a self-taught camper and using Windows machines instead of everyone using Max and going through tutorials where the software changes so often so fast that you run the,nd close to open up something and then you get a newer version compatibility and then and then and then put the rabbit hole 4 months because I would try to be learning the bloated framework and my system was incompatible have that oversight I didn't have that help that guy ins ignore no don't do it this way do it the other way instead all you see when you get this are not enough. I do know that eventually I went down from learning all these top facebook and Google and Airbnb and everyone requires you to have and I just started going down to the basics of the basic HTML cSS and JavaScript and then I eventually got to where I'm at now where I'm able to open up a blank page open up to copy paste from code to the JavaScript to do the different functions and effects and use my little building blocks in Lego pieces of different function that I'll be able to connect everything efficiently and now with gas truck i'm there so many tools and resources that as long as you know the idea of what it is and what you're trying to do and the Technologies to use it and you're able to use all these tools and resources that are free they're f****** free some of them are free most of them are free salami have to pay a few dollars but they provide so much value terms of what you can create and what you can do that as long as you know the ideas of what it is and what you need to do you can just take the Lego pieces and building blocks that other people have built that make sure that it's working tools effectively. Chucky or whatever you want to achieve instead of going down all the way starting from a blank page building locations and then eventually build something that is happy because the structure was kind of being held on until you. We don't really know what it does but eventually you build up those things where you're going to just copy and paste it is what it is and literally programming your bra through the internet you literally do that you use those tools was Resources with applications whose functions in order to achieve what you want to achieve to increase your productivity and be able to program your Bronco the internet and disseminate your ideas or brand your everything give me internet on a Jeep what you want to achieve so zero with the Y on the programming but next thing we really doing is goals in terms of how massive should our goals be in order to achieve and we want to achieve so this is the last subsection of 0 Y and it's the gold so after the Gold bring it over to chapter one which is check my branding so next subsection is gold all right if I can go and actually let me just give you a little little hint your gold cap they have to be next chapter

All right chapter 0 goals now how big do our goals have to be in order to achieve what the f*** you want to achieve we need to have these massive gold now there's a lot of misinformation out there especially that's disseminated through society that being average is where you want to be at an average house average life average income average car average kids average yard average self average paycheck average wage average everything but that is a shity way to live because if your goal is just to be average if it'll think about where you're going if you're going now you're just building towards is average is just normal and just doesn't make any sense. Over there that ideal version of who I want to be above what I want to do and what the f*** I want my life to be that thing that idea worked with that. Should not average it shouldn't be too just in time to just do okay you should be to achieve everything so that idea of building massive goals and working towards them with massive action correlates with all of the successful people that you and I both know you will. No dejarse Elon Musk Joe Rogan all those people even celebrities politicians whatever whoever those staff with achieving massive thing and do you know anyone who achieved something massive but wasn't obsessed or didn't do math know you've no you don't because they were not because they did not work toward so think about worst case scenario oh I don't want to make these big goals because what happens if I don't achieve and then I'm just going to feel work wrong wrong imagine that ideal like that idea version you want to be rich want to be an astronaut you want to go to the Moon you want to end world hunger you want to provide housing for everyone where the f*** you want to do think of that board. Where you're going to get Ford's if you put your full force and energy into achieving. Gold imagine where you're going to end up if you work for that entire life and you become a success and you always growing you change and you're always working towards living. Like what you want to achieve that life goes like this and goes like that and sometimes it goes like this and go but the only way you will fail with achieving that is if you stop literally when you die that's it but if you're working towards and you make all these changes can you provide all that positive impact we wanted to do right that you wanted to live your best life and you wanted to do your best okay then what are your goals what do you want to cheat what's that massive thing I'm going to share with you my goals so I'm you can have just the structure on my mentality play thinking because again think of the big big big goal that you want to achieve and then when you think of that you got a time is it at least at least a thousand more towards a million times it by that you're going to need to exponentiate so if your goal is I want to make $1000000 a hundred thousand dollars more than that because when you get to that if your goal is old mega million dollars and that goal is up here what happens when you probably are never going to reach it because it's all of that thing over there but if you're constantly growing you're constantly building towards those massive goals with a Massive Action then you're only going to cheat more than you can possibly imagine if you continue to grow and change and adapt and really understand what you want to be doing and live your best life and that is Success the success of life is doing what the f*** you want to be doing providing the most impact positive impact out into the world and getting rewarded as a result the money the fame everything will come as a result of you doing your hundred percent Bass want to achieve constantly growing now one thing about achieving going for that thing over there I see you over there. It's just I know who the f*** I am and who I want to be sold again let me show you my goals so George Perez president 2028 USA I am providing the most positive value. Go to the world this hypermedia course is audiobook this publishing is just one little piece is only $10 and that's scalable on whoever wants to learn through the experiences and the perspective of Newton's Productions the course is already there the objective vacation the packaging up on that idea of programming your brain to the internet. What's the world in a package. If you don't the $10 so that's scalable and when I provide all that positive. How to get to the world using my hobby skills and interest my perspective my art my value and I do it very efficiently and I'm scale. What's the result how many can I possibly sell how many hypermedia course it can I talk with yourself okay and I create more and I help others create more and I use all of my hobbies skills and interests in order to grow with his production achieve everything I want to achieve so there's other things in terms of other than whole presidency the presidency aspect of a reaching for is understanding the need. The world and me wanting to step up and be a part of that answer and take on that role being leader and being the support for all of our citizens of the world not only Americans but everywhere else in the world I also am working on. Building all of these large housing structures of tiny houses to end the issue of homelessness and higher rents the whole shelter situation there's also goals to reach trillions of dollars income and net worth the richest person in the world currently you're not even doing nowhere near being worth a trillion dollars either companies are Apple just reached a trillion dollars malaysian but you yourself oh oh my God that's so that's if I have that big. Then I worked or I don't just stop at a million I don't just stop at a feeling I keep going I think of all of the problems that are going to happen as I work towards. I need my space I can't think of a problem maybe happen when I think of those problems of becoming a trillionaire becoming the president providing the most positive impact on in the world helping all of this housing all of these people sharing the information sharing the resources Sharon education to be able to have everyone build their brand and program what they want to and disseminate their ideas and achieve everything they want to achieve through packaging about my perspective and all the other. We going through looking production and although their positive energy that I share with you on a daily basis and scaling. New Politics. Healthcare through entertainment and when I think of that way to live for me up in the morning and I think of those gold so those gold happy now so think of what you want to achieve again think of leaving your back ideal like how do you want to look who you want to be with who you want to be surrounded with what would you be doing on that daily basis where would you be traveling what type of value would you be giving back what would you be consuming what would you be doing that by a thousand by a million now. How do you go in life and you work towards that massive bull ears are coming up with all these problems with the solution of the universe and the universe itself back to you start seeing all of these opportunities and the universe will never prevent to you an opportunity that you cannot use the most of your advantage because you won't even see it but if you're committed to a cheating when you want to achieve and you use everything around you the most of your at. Then those opportunities will come you will literally created opportunities and you will see everything the way meant to be seen because you're again moving everything want to be doing and you're committing yourself hundred percent in a cheating everything you want to achieve so make them massive time zones by 1000 by a million think of those start working out those problem and commit and every time there is something that you know you should be doing but can do it you're already working towards that goal are you going to be doing other than what the f*** you want to be doing to achieve your best life. Doctor you're so f****** start all right start and take down. Take them. And while we're moving on to chapter one branding again George Perez to get me questions or concerns call 424-4004 batman or email Le Conte all right I love you with f****** go chapter one coming up
