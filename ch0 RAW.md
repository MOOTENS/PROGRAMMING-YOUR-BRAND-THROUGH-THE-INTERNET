Chapter 0: Family History

The history of my dad's side:

My dad's name is Jose De Jesus Perez and he grew up in a small farm town.


Apozol, Guadalajara.

He has this story of being able to own a radio.

They're one of the first families to own a radio in the village.

Batteries were a commodity so they had to take out a big D batteries and put them out of the sun and that would recharge it enough to have the radio play the local stations.


My dad left Mexico when he was 15 he was helping with the farm and at 15 he had the opportunity to go to the "new world" which the United States.


 Just propertunities, for jobs.
 
 It was a new world to him.
 
 My grandpa had worked on the U.S. Railroad and there's a lot of history beyond that.
 
 My dad came, he worked, he met my mom.
 
 
 They were childhood friends in terms of the village that theygroup in in was small.
 
 In those rural towns of Mexico, every one really knows every so everyone was not surprised when they were together (I'm assuming).
 
 
 He worked his ass off and he showed us what hard work really is.
 
 
 When I think of the impact that my dad had on me:
 
 For sure one of the main things are:
 
 Working your ass off.
 
 Working fucking hard.
 
 Working at 100%
 
 I thank you because I am who I am because of you.
 
 The idea of where we come from and everything that we've gone through is nothing compared to what our parents had to go through.
 
 
 The idea of this life, of having children, of continuing your seed and your genetics:
 
 We want to make our lives "easier" for us.
 
 "Easier".
 
 We also want to make it "easier" for our kids.
 
 "Easier" really means:
 

 More opportunities.
 
 More education.
 
 More tools.
 
 More resources.
 
 To be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
 
 The "typical" way is schooling.
 
 Right?
 
 We go to school.
 
 we get our education.
 
 
 We get our degree, our GPA.
 
 We get a job based on that degree.
 
 We save up money to buy a house and everything.
 
 We for sure are following along in those paths and in that journey, but:
 
 That is not "THE" correct path beacause when we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 When we are held down by these limitations of:
 
 "Work".
 
 We feel like we're "busy".
 
 Or feel like we're tired.
 
 
 That means we are not doing what we want to be doing.
 
 So if you are doing what you want to be doing then you're going to have lots of energy, feel full, and excited.
 
 The other key to this is you have to be obsessed with what you want to do.

 AND DO IT.
 
 If you are obsessed and if you are commited with what you want to achieve and you do everything that you want to do at 100%
 
 What's going to be the result?
 
 You're going to fucking achieve everything you want to achieve!
 
 You have to keep working on it and you only stop when you die.
 
 Retirement is a myth!
 
 You are going to continue to work.
 
 Continue to live your best life until the moment that you die.
 
 This idea that you work, work, work and then all of a sudden he just stop is not the right idea.
 
 You were and then all the sudden it just stopped 

is not the right idea 

 because every single moment. 

In this reality 

you are working 

every time you breathe your meth 

 work is constantly being done 

even if you do nothing like 

doing nothing in a lot of work 

a lot of f****** work 

so let's go ahead and do what the f*** you want to do and I 

think our parents 

think our family 

think our connection t 

hink ancestors 

think our lineage 

because we would not be here without the help of them 

and it's our job to continue and 

continue to provide the best possible life 

for everyone not only our kids but our children from the earth 

 everyone 

even if they're strangers 

 in the permanent another Nation 

doesn't matter 

 we need to do our best buy us to meet 

 our bass 

automatically everyone in the world improved 

so thank you for doing your best 

when I'm better you're better 

 when you're better I'm better 

when we're going to continue on TV a program 

 we are going to go over the schooling academic aspect of the dark 

 so just so you have the information about me and where all of this is coming from 

 because there is a certain approach 

 of how to view with problems 

and depending on the education that you get 

 of the experiences that you have 

their different ways of approaching but 

 I'm going to show you my background 

 just so you have some experience 

and how bad help me and some ways that really help me 

but overall because we are here right now in this very moment 

 everything that happened was exactly the way I'm supposed 

 to have 

all right I want to give a little bit more emphasis on my mom's story 

 so she grou with my both of my aunts and my grandma 

 has four of them three sisters at the mall 

our Grandpa was not a very good provider 

so he decided excited to live the life that he lived and he suffered greatly for it 

but because he suffered later on in his life 

to have a good life of what he wanted 

to live without our family without his daughters without his wife 

then ultimately my mom's side of the family suffered and 

 my grandpa ultimately sufffered at his end of life 

so because my grandpa was not a part of our family 

my grandma and my mom and aunts have to provide for themselves 

my grandma has this store rest in peace 

she needed to make money 

so she would make Jello for the neighborhood 

shooting make big batches of Jell-O which she wouldn't sell to 

 some local people who would then take that Jello break it up 

and then sell it and self profit 

and then my mom aunts and what all food do seamstress seen in. 

Type cloth type of work as well as having a different jobs 

they also built their house from the ground up all by themselves 

that entrepreneurial ship type of drive

 for sure is a big part of what makes me me 

 my mom and her experience reality \ 

combined with my dad's hard work ethic 

have made me who I am so 

I am nothing but proud of where I come from 

and the Legacy. I'm Leaving On To The Future Generations so 


thank you

All right chapter 0 why academics


so I graduated from Southern California high school


Henry J Kaiser High School 

it was in Fontana 

and Fontana is famous for the steel mill and the speedway 


it was actually a pound city that was made in order to produce steel for the war and others a story. 


Kamizase Aziz I would run out of gas by the time they production plant so they wouldn't be able to bond it 




it's an hour East from LA and

from there that steel mill all those families working for the effort needed to have health care

so one of the owners from the Kaiser steel mill Kaiser High School 

and Kaiser health care 

I graduated with a 3.8 in high school 

I was very smart growing up 

I read out on a high reading level

I was always getting mad 

because I was pushed towards that 

I remember having to memorize the times tables up to 10 by the time I was like first second grade 


actually skip first grade because I was so smart 

I got straight A's in second grade 

but I was held back I was too short and 


they said that I would get bullied if I moved on 

I did very good in a high school because I knew the game 

the game was just memorization 

it was just read this part of the textbook answer these questions 

and you're testing to be based on memorization 

that is the lowest form of education 

but that's what we were talking and I went to Community College with the goal to become a registered nurse again. 

Very similar it is lots of memorization but you have to apply those memorization along with skills to provide patient care to be a nurse 

so everything that I through High School community College California State University Sacramento where I got my. Science in nursing I'm a registered nurse 

everything has taught me where I am when I'm going to be doing in the future because of everything that I've learned

I used to be wanting to compartmentalize my life into o I only do this or I'm only there for I do this but

in reality all of my experiences make me who I am 

from there it makes up the value that i provide back out to you. 

So the reason why I'm bringing this up in this type of media course of programming and brown through the internet

is to let you know that you don't necessarily need a

marketing background f

or an art. 

Programming. 

Literally you can create whatever the f*** you want to create 

if you just put your hundred percent full form and 

instead of spinning your wheels and

trying to figure everything out and

try to learn from different people and

do things kind of halfway and experiment

I'm going to give you the guidelines that all of the other brands that are successful and companies and government Healthcare everything 

we're going to use the industry-standard launching point to where 


we're going to be growing our brand and where

we're going to be disseminating our ideas and information into the whole world and

this structure is through MOOTENS production and 

the whole guideline everything is compartmentalize into a box called programming your brain to the Internet 

so after I went to school and I got my nursing degree my.

By the nursing I got my first job as a nurse I was a primary care nurse at a local federally qualified Health Center 

which is code word for we accept anyone and everyone

in all of my skills into being able to provide the best care to everyone who came in through our doors

I use my experience of working at Jack In The Box 

and of my schooling and of everything in order to provide the best care

and because of that I thrive everywhere  I go

no matter what position I am placed in 

I guarantee that I am able to make the most down call positive impact because of all of my experience 

instead of focusing just on being a nurse and having that aspect I use my education in order to achieve everything in 

Care Medical Care Health Care to a person that is sick and come in through some door

no we need to provide this experience and education to everyone in the world 

and the healthcare Optical programming your brand through the internet is more months and

its thoughts feelings and actions. 

And there's a lot of mental health advice that is disseminated through this program 

the basic idea of the Nursing degree and the healthcare screen back

to be committed

to do what the f*** you want to do

if you are feeling anxious and you're unsure healing. 

Not Normal feeling to have okay 

you need to stop

right

talk 

meditate

draw

you need to work out.

He can't just be how deep down

you to push it down for sure but it's not the best way to live because you're not doing what you want to be doing 

do you really want to be feeling that.

You don't talk that the reason why you get that feeling is that discomfort

is you knowing that you're not doing supposed to be doing.

What you doing so lean into that discomfort

grill the most achieve everything you want

to achieve through Massive Action 

every limitation that there is in life

with Ruby time energy space 

everything can be over, massive Action and 

the amount of Massive Action that you put in

literally Corley how much you get back and

you decide how much action you're going to put

I'm telling you it should be. Do what the f*** you want to do

all right

next thing when you go over how I came to the realization

why I have this mindset and where it comes from

next thing is going to be my set 

in the terms of the people like the

retirement and th

existential crisis

setting up the structure up before hypermedia course

---


All right we're to go over some real s*** right now we are going over programming your brand through the internet chapter 0 Y and now we're going on to be existential crisis moment. Realized what the f*** do I need to be doing so this realization if HIPAA need this thing. I feel like everyone has this moment and everyone has these moments where they can look back and they can say okay this thing that happened it happened this way and now I'm here because of that but what does that mean what does that mean in order to change there needs to be a spark within spark that's how it starts and then the fire goes and then eventually. Inferno and. Got your stool that's your spirit that's your energy. F*** you want to be doing so. Markdown talking about is the spark that pushed me into realizing what do I want to be doing what's like what is this what is this world what are we doing so how I got there is my whole life my whole life I wanted to be successful to have a house to have a wife have a family provides the most impact be positive live that good life but really I was so caught up so, and with achieving what I thought I need to achieve which was. Education. Job the getting a new car and moving in with the girlfriend now why and having that stable job having that ink having. $3 an hour $40 I started with $31 power and I moved in with Tracy we have an apartment we had our cats and but you don't want to achieve I was a nurse I got a job now I had a car I don't have to worry about it breaking down now we're thinking about buying a house to this life is is not good is not good because there's no growth that was happening during that time Tracy was growing she was doing her modeling she was taking time and energy and space to build program to build herself to developer skills hobbies and interests and I I cheated you want to achieve I got my license I got my degree I did everything eventually maybe I would become a provider a nurse practitioner and something else but... Part of what I really wanted to be doing because I work my whole life to achieve what I wanted to achieve which was to become a nurse and registered nurse and now that it was here now what I said that's it no that's not it so we push forward we got our house we moved in we got everything set up exactly how we wanted to set it up we tore down the wall we renovated the kitchen the bathroom and I have my computer I have my objects my things we would go to restaurant we were not really worrying about money that's life I do know how to cope because I would do a hundred percent at work but when I would do so much of my hundred percent at work I would have to come home and be exhausted I think I would have to come home and be exhausted that was the Trap. That I had put myself I put those limitation onto my life they work hundred percent go to work and then come home and do nothing yeah I work so hard all day that I die go to do nothing and just enjoy life and be comfortable and decided but I know that. Not the back way to live because you're not growing you're not changing Bridget stag and that is not a good way to live so how would I cope well 8 to 5 is Monday through Friday. Work schedule I would come home 5 p.m. Turn off my clothes put on my home clothes make something to eat turn on the projector go on YouTube and Just auto play all day just YouTube video after video after video after video and not healthy not healthy at all why I come home and I just plot in front of the couch and I just get all of the con all these videos on the sound is it numb me out while I just push everything else. At Pinewood progressed I would start getting anxiety underlying anxiety this feeling. Do you that would grow more and more and more and more and more I would not grow just like you do something good and something else could happen they something else good and something more positive comes to you as well I do nothing I do nothing at home. So the existential moment. Was that I Came Upon it was around 1 or 2 a.m. I was watching a bunch of YouTube videos on auto-play and call the next video. I'm about to play was about Bitcoin and for some reason or another I had the YouTube I saw the recommended videos and then the auto until you see what the next video. And for the past seven eight hours. The projector whirring overhead I did not even touch the keyboard because I would just let the YouTube algorithm feed me whatever I want going to feed me and I went down this rabbit hole news bloopers then. And then. Just other information and then it the YouTube algorithm got to a point recommend me a video about Bitcoin and something inside of me something decided to know I don't watch that let me go to the next one I have to stop and think what am I doing i'm literally the moment where I decided I don't want to watch this and I took that action II I found myself on my way over way what am I doing why at this moment why am I so averse to going down this path and I realize now that that was the discomfort I did not want to watch you because it was something new something that I have been pushing down and that pushing down was a Bitcoin is the money I read about it in 2010/2011 sometime I don't have to watch it and just that. Just because I know what it is I don't want to watch it why am I so averse to watching this I remember this moment specifically because this was one of my existential crisis moments where I realized my actions and I watched that video and I just got this feeling of Goosebumps it was just this feeling. I was just watching over me I had no f****** idea what they Quinn was what it really mad for the future was going or what it really was and I watch. I forced myself to watch. And I realized I have no idea what the f*** this is and the more I started doing research into it the more I realized oh my God this and future I thought I knew what it was and here is the answer as to what is money what is line what is job what is this reality is world what are we doing what are we working towards money cardi of money put that what is that like just that moment like we're waiting for. So you can buy a projector so you can consume contact when I went down that rabbit-hole I open them my eyes really asked to what is this reality what is this world this Earth these nations in governments this money this form of control what is this what is this instead of going to work on your bass coming consuming content being entertained getting my bread and circuses eating fast food spending money working through a hundred percent being stressed not coping not growing. Do you want to be doing and from that moment on this was around February 2018 I'm late February I just turn my life around again my light turned around from that spark from that moment that I have to look back into my life and think what the f*** what is this what is money what is this like what am I working toward what are we working toward what is this what does it mean to be a human we're all Spiritual Beings having a human experience I realize that now but like what we doing so the moment. You we have that spark. Stop going you can either. And make that go away turn it down even more or you can feed into it you can feed it if you can be like that what is that I don't do what I'm supposed to be doing so whatever that moment is for you you have to decide you have to make it real you can't just only has kind of that thing that kind of over there no you have to be able to explain it because that makes you who you are the better you are able to verbalize your thoughts feelings the better you're able to control them and then the bed rate while you're able to achieve everything you want to achieve so that was my little existential moment story others definitely more Tiffany moments draw that I had and I'm going to continue to have but that is one of the main reasons why I am here today from that spark that broke me out of that Loop of give me the consumer and just being a hard worker and not doing what I want to be doing so now I'm going to talk about the programming idea my education my background and a self-taught developer a programmer and I've only been programming or around the year and I am already at that level where I'm able to cheat everything I want to achieve using all of the Technologies which is HTML CSS and JavaScript that's the building block the internet and that's literally what's needed to program for brown through the internet even if you don't know specifically as long as you know the details of what it is and what it does and then you're able to just out sort all those things that you don't want to do or that you are able to do what you want to do using the building block I showed you hear through rocket internet program

---


All right chapter 0 why programming so the goal of programming really is to put those ideas that you have in your head and make them real through a computer when you make it real to a computer then you're able to digitize that idea and spread it to everyone in the world to the Internet so I'm that idea programming what what do you mean by idea literally if you write your things and you submitted I'm not easy form of programming really HTML is a programming language it's the structure of the internet so if you're able to build HTML code if you would make a Blog to make your own website you're f****** program where there's literally people that enjoy the WordPress learn how to drag and drop images and use templates to make website front-end web developer they're on the lower Dam because they don't really know the backend stuff they just know how to make the website look pretty and two connecting but really what do you want to be doing do you learn algorithms to be able to sort. Data to work for Google to connect all these people to the internet through them and I used to think the idea of programming was to go on the computer type out some stuff and create some programs and people use them and somehow you get paid for it companies will pay you to program their website or Dare program their back something along those lines maybe something with computers like building computers building Hardware or making games or something like that but yes you can literally do what the f*** you want to do literally do anything and everything you can possibly think of and there's this meme. I said I wish I learned I wish I knew how to program and then someone grabs their hand they stick a pen and then they put it on paper and ink they start programming and then idea is again putting those ideas that and digitizing them in a way that the computer can make sense of those ideas so as as we get more deep programming your Bronco The Intern it basically the specifics but again cuz all these tools and resources that you if you don't want to take that time and energy and space into learning those skills yourself more you're into this the more you grow into this the more come in terms of your experience and your education because you'll learn what you want to learn full of all of this information technology courses I'm thinking we want to be doing but I started around the year ago from today late 2018 I knew that I needed to be doing something else other than just watching YouTube and I'm coming home and having an underlying anxiety and that lack of growth and stagnation would I'm going towards other areas of life so that was not good and I need you to do something so when I got into Bitcoin I realized okay this is the future this is any internet starting right now we are in the moments of the initial part of the cryptocurrency movement and I want to get in on this because it's something that I'm passionate about I'm at I want to do and I thought that thing was a big nice to feel in the cryptocurrency community in terms of content and new engagement and everything so I signed up for steam it. Reddit you post blogs and when people up boat you you get cryptocurrency and I went into this all right I want to be doing some photoshop I want to do videos I want to engagement Community I want to be a part of his coming in put myself out there and give Donald Trump. But also receive a lie back as well from all of the work that I put in and just starting out I made a YouTube account and then I probably did that for a few months before I realized okay and it's this Khan it wasn't working because I would just go to work and I'll do my nursing job and then I'll come home and not really engage fully maybe I'll do a video about spend the day doing a video that I posted by the end of the night and then I would have really follow up and then I would make like a video a week and then a video a day and then I will delve into all these different ideas of social media and content but it wasn't really working out so I realized all right what do I really want to be doing as well so I decided I'm around a year ago around September 2018 to Starling program so what did I do how to program best programming language to learn python python is a high-level program stop literally you're able to do anything and everything you can possibly think of what the program and why would you can do that with python and I did I was I was committed I knew that. I need to learn to program and python was one of the best auctions so I went into it I downloaded my resources my but I followed the chapters I was going along with it but I went to like 15 chapters in the first week and I realized that nothing was sticking and I force myself through it to learn it to get like the basics of it but I got to a point where I could literally make anything and everything. Wanted to make and then I had to step back and think what what I want to do and eventually the idea connected with everything that I was working on like the half moon half maintains the moontones the music that I was making the little art project I was doing I would just put as the structure so if I made a image if I was wanting to develop my skills and Photoshop and just mess around and creates an image has helped slap a move him down there whenever they would be I would make a song to Fruity Loops FL Studio and I was messing around with. Software do you want to learn it what's the artist and the song on same thing with video on video with the channel. So that idea of creating content putting it out there branding you. And in the programming what's the variable name what program do I want to create what's the folder with the repository name or this variable name will be called in it and its variable name we called move and everything combined eventually into what it is today which is everything combined all the hobbies and interests. Audio images video programming on spreading ideas understanding our feelings on doing big things and actually living our best lives everything let's of that and the eventuality of where we got to where we're at with the programming is I would delve into the front-end web. Which is how it looks visually the button do you click and everything and I decided to go a separate route from the typical cord like if you learn programming and you go to bootcamp and you develop your skills to work as a developer in Silicon Valley in the Bay Area then you're going to learn always bloated as Frameworks like react and other Frameworks that like PHP built from all the programming language is the great but the problem with the framework is that they're built so high and so bloated that just even start programming the specific language have to go to mom's death and release come down and being a self-taught camper and using Windows machines instead of everyone using Max and going through tutorials where the software changes so often so fast that you run the,nd close to open up something and then you get a newer version compatibility and then and then and then put the rabbit hole 4 months because I would try to be learning the bloated framework and my system was incompatible have that oversight I didn't have that help that guy ins ignore no don't do it this way do it the other way instead all you see when you get this are not enough. I do know that eventually I went down from learning all these top facebook and Google and Airbnb and everyone requires you to have and I just started going down to the basics of the basic HTML cSS and JavaScript and then I eventually got to where I'm at now where I'm able to open up a blank page open up to copy paste from code to the JavaScript to do the different functions and effects and use my little building blocks in Lego pieces of different function that I'll be able to connect everything efficiently and now with gas truck i'm there so many tools and resources that as long as you know the idea of what it is and what you're trying to do and the Technologies to use it and you're able to use all these tools and resources that are free they're f****** free some of them are free most of them are free salami have to pay a few dollars but they provide so much value terms of what you can create and what you can do that as long as you know the ideas of what it is and what you need to do you can just take the Lego pieces and building blocks that other people have built that make sure that it's working tools effectively. Chucky or whatever you want to achieve instead of going down all the way starting from a blank page building locations and then eventually build something that is happy because the structure was kind of being held on until you. We don't really know what it does but eventually you build up those things where you're going to just copy and paste it is what it is and literally programming your bra through the internet you literally do that you use those tools was Resources with applications whose functions in order to achieve what you want to achieve to increase your productivity and be able to program your Bronco the internet and disseminate your ideas or brand your everything give me internet on a Jeep what you want to achieve so zero with the Y on the programming but next thing we really doing is goals in terms of how massive should our goals be in order to achieve and we want to achieve so this is the last subsection of 0 Y and it's the gold so after the Gold bring it over to chapter one which is check my branding so next subsection is gold all right if I can go and actually let me just give you a little little hint your gold cap they have to be next chapter

---

All right chapter 0 goals now how big do our goals have to be in order to achieve what the f*** you want to achieve we need to have these massive gold now there's a lot of misinformation out there especially that's disseminated through society that being average is where you want to be at an average house average life average income average car average kids average yard average self average paycheck average wage average everything but that is a shity way to live because if your goal is just to be average if it'll think about where you're going if you're going now you're just building towards is average is just normal and just doesn't make any sense. Over there that ideal version of who I want to be above what I want to do and what the f*** I want my life to be that thing that idea worked with that. Should not average it shouldn't be too just in time to just do okay you should be to achieve everything so that idea of building massive goals and working towards them with massive action correlates with all of the successful people that you and I both know you will. No dejarse Elon Musk Joe Rogan all those people even celebrities politicians whatever whoever those staff with achieving massive thing and do you know anyone who achieved something massive but wasn't obsessed or didn't do math know you've no you don't because they were not because they did not work toward so think about worst case scenario oh I don't want to make these big goals because what happens if I don't achieve and then I'm just going to feel work wrong wrong imagine that ideal like that idea version you want to be rich want to be an astronaut you want to go to the Moon you want to end world hunger you want to provide housing for everyone where the f*** you want to do think of that board. Where you're going to get Ford's if you put your full force and energy into achieving. Gold imagine where you're going to end up if you work for that entire life and you become a success and you always growing you change and you're always working towards living. Like what you want to achieve that life goes like this and goes like that and sometimes it goes like this and go but the only way you will fail with achieving that is if you stop literally when you die that's it but if you're working towards and you make all these changes can you provide all that positive impact we wanted to do right that you wanted to live your best life and you wanted to do your best okay then what are your goals what do you want to cheat what's that massive thing I'm going to share with you my goals so I'm you can have just the structure on my mentality play thinking because again think of the big big big goal that you want to achieve and then when you think of that you got a time is it at least at least a thousand more towards a million times it by that you're going to need to exponentiate so if your goal is I want to make $1000000 a hundred thousand dollars more than that because when you get to that if your goal is old mega million dollars and that goal is up here what happens when you probably are never going to reach it because it's all of that thing over there but if you're constantly growing you're constantly building towards those massive goals with a Massive Action then you're only going to cheat more than you can possibly imagine if you continue to grow and change and adapt and really understand what you want to be doing and live your best life and that is Success the success of life is doing what the f*** you want to be doing providing the most impact positive impact out into the world and getting rewarded as a result the money the fame everything will come as a result of you doing your hundred percent Bass want to achieve constantly growing now one thing about achieving going for that thing over there I see you over there. It's just I know who the f*** I am and who I want to be sold again let me show you my goals so George Perez president 2028 USA I am providing the most positive value. Go to the world this hypermedia course is audiobook this publishing is just one little piece is only $10 and that's scalable on whoever wants to learn through the experiences and the perspective of Newton's Productions the course is already there the objective vacation the packaging up on that idea of programming your brain to the internet. What's the world in a package. If you don't the $10 so that's scalable and when I provide all that positive. How to get to the world using my hobby skills and interest my perspective my art my value and I do it very efficiently and I'm scale. What's the result how many can I possibly sell how many hypermedia course it can I talk with yourself okay and I create more and I help others create more and I use all of my hobbies skills and interests in order to grow with his production achieve everything I want to achieve so there's other things in terms of other than whole presidency the presidency aspect of a reaching for is understanding the need. The world and me wanting to step up and be a part of that answer and take on that role being leader and being the support for all of our citizens of the world not only Americans but everywhere else in the world I also am working on. Building all of these large housing structures of tiny houses to end the issue of homelessness and higher rents the whole shelter situation there's also goals to reach trillions of dollars income and net worth the richest person in the world currently you're not even doing nowhere near being worth a trillion dollars either companies are Apple just reached a trillion dollars malaysian but you yourself oh oh my God that's so that's if I have that big. Then I worked or I don't just stop at a million I don't just stop at a feeling I keep going I think of all of the problems that are going to happen as I work towards.

How do you go in life and you work towards that massive bull ears are coming up with all these problems with the solution of the universe and the universe itself back to you start seeing all of these opportunities and the universe will never prevent to you an opportunity that you cannot use the most of your advantage because you won't even see it but if you're committed to a cheating when you want to achieve and you use everything around you the most of your at. Then those opportunities will come you will literally created opportunities and you will see everything the way meant to be seen because you're again moving everything want to be doing and you're committing yourself hundred percent in a cheating everything you want to achieve so make them massive time zones by 1000 by a million think of those start working out those problem and commit and every time there is something that you know you should be doing but can do it you're already working towards that goal are you going to be doing other than what the f*** you want to be doing to achieve your best life.
