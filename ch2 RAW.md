All right chapter 2 back-end infrastructure now what is back-end back-end infrastructure the building block the actual function the thing that connect the ground through the internet to the people and the program is called programming do brown through the internet and other avenues you're able to achieve what you want to achieve but the program through the internet about the platform and the email the data collection the data reporting and basically this chapter I want to set up the structure of how using the internet and how we're going to be disseminate ER Brown give me the internet so we have the internet first you need internet okay if you are going to be programming your Brandy and met you need internet so I'll make sure you have a workstation. You're able to reliably produced content and document and continue growing your breath you need a workstation you need a laptop or desktop need a phone you need writing you need paper uni printer you need microphone you need all of this. And infrastructure unicameral webcams lighting location stays give me lots of things but when we think about programming a brand to the internet you're going to need email okay that's number one so first go ahead and get a Gmail account on Gmail account and or come in and open up an incognito window and go to Gmail. Create another Gmail account now I have multiple email accounts just because I don't want to bog everything down one thing and I don't have a email account with your contact. Org he's also other Gmail account and a Hotmail account on a different things that are used for different purposes as long as you keep it organized and you use the programs like Chrome to be able to save your password and save your account setting everything across different devices as long as you're using everything to the most of your advantage and everything's going to be consistent everything's going to be across the flat but obviously you want on physical backups as well program through the internet you already have your email account obviously it's your brand at gmail.com even if you don't get your specific brand name you want to get it very similar so mutans is production by Gmail. Within China let you know. Nine at gmail.com a lot of things but you go ahead and make a name email account where you want people to contact you just because you can create and you are going to create a Gmail account and all these different things you are wanting to have a funnel for all of your main contact ability instead of having to check all these different emails and having to Route everything and making sure everything come now I'm just make one main email the me to email you're going to put it in your business card what do you have your email account then you can start making all of your different accounts into different platforms Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Instagram steal everything anything and everything that you can use to disseminate your brown you want to use that back what structure to the idea of programming your brown through the internet you need to do all of the all of the services all of the website you want to get your name your message your ideas your products or Services your information you want to spread. Out through the internet so we can search your brand on Google and you only have a few hundred years old or a fuse. Think about that idea okay just think about that idea you want the search results you want your data you want your continued on your brown you want that s*** spread everywhere so you and everything's in the most of your photo on Instagram on a platform and you have the ability to post it somewhere else and do all these things and talk about it in packets you want to be able to increase your search result do you want your brand on Google search when you search your brown on Google there should be a pocket knife in this should be a huge amount of I'm search results based on the content that you provided tape copy and paste near Brandon peek musical place now you because you're not going to be working for them to be efficient you're not going to be available it's so as machine as the living organisms that we are that is our cells are spirits also our brand we are we consume and we also create data collection and data reporting so we're in taking and we're out putting now. Taking it is hot formation and feelings and thoughts in action that's what we're in taking so whenever we can say we process that software through our hardware and were able to apply all of that new information with all of the data that's already available to buy based on their experience and then we're able to fly that with whatever we want to do whenever we want to achieve so when we think of data collection and Reporting ask our brand what data do you want to collect what things do we want to consume and it literally makes up what you as a brand are what your bra so if your brand is based on cryptocurrency Jernigan growing everything is going to be changing on those changes from the environment from the intake that you are taking in a bra company you are not welcome and what are you in putting what date are you collecting while you're collecting information about how many you're selling about different competitors will bring out bras do you want to learn about manufacturing about how other states about how other countries are doing it and the different medical procedures that could be prevented from the Pacific Service. Provides from reducing. All of this, can you run back stop working your hardware and you create more now you have more valuable information more up-to-date back to the world back to everyone all of your audience so that is the infrastructure of data collection and the back-end infrastructure how are you doing but not based around the providing which is the next chapter but when. Idea of in taking information in thinking cons use understanding these new developments doing more research to allow your grass to grow over thinking of that you're thinking of the infrastructure what you want to you want to consume and then sometimes you open it when you're taking a s*** and you read from you kind of do that when you're consuming a lot you already going to be producing a lot and again. Massive Action and massive gold where you're being taken so much. The only result is your outputting as well because you're in taking lot and when think of the infrastructure you want to think about where you want to get your news with your bookmarks where you get your resources from how you want to dock you how you want to share that with the world how you want to condense it and change it and refer back to it and save it and back-end infrastructure so if you're already using Chrome as your web browser on whatever Linux on Apple Windows whatever you're using if you're using a web browser like Chrome that can sing all of your information and data and settings across all the different devices then you just have your bookmarks and you just have your information and you have your platforms and you have your different account now I'm not really going to give you any specific platforms like only just look at who is successful how people are using it and you can exploit the s*** out of it you see old people style and this is what people like in this is what people engage with and you automatically see and you apply it to your brand and you putting your value and your perspective and your ex treating you listen to it and provide feedback. You continue to grow from that are going to be absorbing everything and again using. Using a structure that infrastructure and infrastructure but you need to be posting a lot relates back to the idea of you want your information spread out all over the Internet you want your Google searches to be huge massive you want to be cross-post play we at least know way more than you need to be constantly posting it's free it's free you're not going to get a bill for it you just going to continue using it while you are using it too much attention Okay you want that why why why why is it bad to where you need to do that you just take all that you can give you feedback you should be consuming any program your DirecTV internet and to send me all your ideas okay and take it processes but again you're committed you know what the f*** you're doing so use that I'd structure minority but most everyone like pretty much this so you use that you'd rather know that information. So pick up the back of the infrastructure and think of how you can use that to most of your advances use Chrome use the same settings use different accounts use them to the most of your advantage keep posting and then the next reporting is the content that you're producing basically. Next chapter which is programming are you allowed to the internet automated contest so instead of spending all of your time just disseminating your ideas if you really do that to 24/7 you're not going to have time to actually do work because that takes a lot of work to be able to Crocs closing you would love this and quit this and copy do this time and word and time and energy space so you want to have the idea of automate. 10 production experience and that work flow because if you automated and green and it might feel like work because it's already automated you already haven't said anything you already have the tools and program the generators everything that you're using so you have that built the last we're going to go over automated content production Chapter 3
