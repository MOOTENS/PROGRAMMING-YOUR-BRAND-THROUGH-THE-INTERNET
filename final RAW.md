Speechnotes is a powerful speech-enabled online notepad, designed to empower your ideas by implementing a clean & efficient design, so you can focus on your thoughts.
We strive to provide the best online dictation tool by engaging cutting-edge speech-recognition technology for the most accurate results technology can achieve today, together with incorporating built-in tools (automatic or manual) to increase users' efficiency, productivity and comfort.

Designed to Inspire Creativity and Keep You Focused
Speechnotes is especially designed to provide you a distraction-free environment.
Every note, starts with a new clear white paper, so to stimulate your mind with a clean fresh start. All other elements but the text itself are out of sight by fading out, so you can concentrate on the most important part - your own creativity.
In addition to that, speaking instead of typing, enables you to think and speak it out fluently, uninterrupted, which again encourages creative, clear thinking. Fonts and colors all over the app were designed to be sharp and have excellent legibility characteristics.


Reviews & Users’ Feedback (higher than 4.5 stars!)
We’ve only been on air for a short while and already featured on “ProductHunt” and other international tech magazines. But we are most proud of our users’ feedback. Speechnotes is the highest ranked speech-recognition app on the Chrome-store, rated higher than 4.5 stars! Well above other online alternatives. Here are some of the user reviews we got on the Chrome store:

"I would like to say that I am very pleased with this dictation plug in. It is better and much more accurate than the other two that I have tried. This is definitely my preferred dictation app.
In fact, I wrote this review using the app.
Thumbs up to the developers!!"

"It does what it says on the tin...& more. Priceless.
Tony Hawes. Whose faith has been restored in Apps by this one."

... And there are many more. Read all of them on the Chrome store

Thanks a lot guys! Your feedback gives us great motivation to keep going in developing great solutions


A Free Alternative to Dragon Naturally Speaking
Speechnotes is completely free & comparable in its accuracy to Dragon Natuarlly Speaking. Many of you told us that in some ways, it even outperforms Dragon. We should mention though, that Speechnotes is an alternative to Dragon for dictation purposes only, not for voice controlling other software and not for voice-typing within other software. Dragon has these additional capabilities. If you need to dictate an article though, you will find Speechnotes not only cheaper, but perhaps even better for you.


Features Built to Increase Productivity & Efficiency for both Voice Typing & Regular Key Typing
For many of us, key-typing is slow and thus time-consuming. Speechnotes lets you type at the speed of speech (slow & clear speech).
Speechnotes lets you move from voice-typing (dictation) to key-typing seamlessly. This way, you can dictate when convenient and type when more appropriate. You can also dictate and edit your text results right away, and continue dictating. No need to go through app modes or even stop dictation.
Insert punctuation marks by speech (voice commands) or by a single click.

Other features built for productivity for both type of typing are:
Auto save that saves the document in real time upon any change, so you don't ever have to disturb yourself with it.
Export to Google Drive (cloud saving) or download as a document to your computer.
One click to email, or print your note.
Automatic smart capitalization of letters at the beginning of sentences.
No Login, registration, installation, or download needed. Works "right out of the box". So, where are all the automatically saved notes stored? Speechnotes stores all your data on your own computer, through your browser. The advantage is that you don't have to sign in. The disadvantage is that you cannot access these documents from other computers. For that - Speechnotes lets you export to Google Drive. Another small disadvantage is that after many many notes, you might run out of storage room, so, it's a good practice to delete from time-to-time unnecessary older notes.
Unlimited usage for free.


Leading Technology
Speechnotes is based on Google's high-end speech-recognition engines. In fact, all your speech is sent to Google, there it gets interpreted using powerful parallel servers and algorithms, and gets sent back to Speechnotes as a stream of possible transcription results. With the right handling of these results and set of commands to the Speech-To-Text engines we are able to achieve results that do not fall in accuracy even when compared to the most professional and expensive software available on the market. Add to that punctuation insertion upon click and voice commands and smart capitalization, and you get one of the most advanced apps out there.
Quantitatively, accuracy levels higher than 90% should be expected.


Health Advantages to Voice Typing
Sitting in front of a computer in general may result in different types of Computer Related Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI). To avoid them the best way is not to sit in front of the computer for long periods of time. But, if you have to, you have to take extra care on your posture. You can read more about it here (http://rsi.unl.edu/). Voice typing is one of the main recommended ways to minimize these risks, as it enables you to sit back comfortably, freeing your arms, hands, shoulders and back altogether. You can get back to typing once finished dictating for corrections & editing.


Instructions & Tips
Pre-operation:
Connect a high-quality microphone to your PC (if you have a built-in microphone it might be good enough).

Operation:
1) Click the mic
2) For the first time only: Your browser will popup a request for you to allow the site to listen to your mic. Click "Allow".
3) Start dictating. Speak slowly and clearly. Space your words and emphasize correct diction for better results.
4) Intermediate results will show in the buffer. There are 3 ways to finalize and shift transcription results from the buffer to the text editor itself:
   (a) Press "Enter" key on the keyboard
   (b) Say or click on a punctuation mark
   (c) Wait

Troubleshooting:
Most common causes for failures are:
1) Hardware problem with the microphone
2) Browser not Chrome
3) Permission to listen not granted
4) Chrome listens to the wrong microphone
To fix the last 2 problems, you should click on the small camera icon in the browser's address bar (will appear after you click the mic) and there set the permission to Allow speechnotes and pick the correct microphone from the drop-down list.


Who can benefit from Speechnotes?
Anyone who is tired of ordinary key-typing might find Speechnotes useful. It might also be helpful specifically for people with difficulties in typing. Such difficulties could be of a result of physical condition, or simply not mastering the keyboard typing technique in an early enough age.
In addition, people who type a lot as their profession or hobby might find Speechnotes very useful as long keyboard typing might be very tyring, and even have medical implications as side effects. Needless to say, transcribers (from students to professionals) will find Speechnotes super helpful, as they can listen to a recording and repeat the speech into the mic, to get Speechnotes to transcribe it for them.


Compatibility & System Requirements
Speechnotes is really a broad-platform app. As long as you run it through a Chrome browser it will work. No need for installation, disk space or high-end machines. It will run smoothly on your PC, desktop, laptop and Chromebook. You might try it on your tablets and phones, but it might have issues with some devices.

Optional Google OAuth - for uploading files to Google Drive
In case you would like to upload files to Google Drive directly from Speechnotes - we'll ask for your permission to do so. We will use that permission for that purpose only - syncing your speech-notes to your Google Drive, per your request.





Terms
Although we try, speech results might not be accurate. Also, Speechnotes is a service provided AS-IS and we cannot guarantee that it will continue in the future. For that reason, and for the small chance that software failures might happen, we suggest you export your important texts either to Google Drive or to your computer, so to be protected against unexpected data loss.
