Out into the world so you have to become into it you have to be 100% behind it and the name is very important because again. Structure of them here now let me give you a few examples before we were examples of lutein canon Canon is a camera brand and indignity do lots of other things too but think of that Meme I keep to praying donald Trump he's a brand his person he's a friend Tracy. The person me Jorge Perez I have my own brand you are your own brand to but it's easier to objectify that brand idea into something that you can please and say okay this is the brand it's called X it's called PayPal it's called Google it called production so again the name that you decide for your brand new have to be committed 100% behind it you have to be committed so much that the specific of the spelling the casing has to be specific as well for example Google has their own when you go on google.com be a big G and then small o o g l e Cannon I'm looking at it right now there's a big c and there's a mof muchas production putin is always in capitals if it can be helped if it can be capitalized should be capital okay now sometimes for like usernames or emails it'll automatically reverted back down to lower case but that's fine because that's a limitation but if I'm going to be creating a brand if I'm going to be slapping that brown.
