All right chapter 6 efficiency again we're going to go over the three chapters the value of fission C and scalability in the same way because they really are. Consensus so we can go over the efficiency who what when where why how time energy and space and again it's all going to be correlated to programming your brand through the internet with the context of efficiency now efficiency is your productivity is the amount of word that you produce all of that work that you give out into the world in terms of your brand in your products and your services and everything that you give out into your world all your social media post all of your energy all of your advertisements all over your interactions all of your networking all of your purchase everything everything that you do in your life as a brand as a spirit. Fish and feed the ability to create more. Good at the more we want to create more give more value back to that house back door and that function that rate. Yeah. Speed. Okay so efficient C4 who the efficiency for who is again for everyone but let's take it back to the efficacy for the cell for the oneself birds that talk about us as Spirits as people the efficiency for the ability to control our thoughts feelings and actions are the direct correlation to the ability to control our efficiency are output our product our services what we get out into the world the more able to control our thoughts feelings and actions now a lot of people think that motivation is Keith I'm just not motivated enough or I need to be motivated to do something some people will use music as a crutch oh I I need I can only exercise if I listen to music I can only do this if I do this other thing. That limitation that you're placing on yourself is up in the governor on your RPMs. Positive Ally provide out of the world. Haitian that you're putting on yourself whatever it maybe it can even be old is life Brite Organix Dam 3 time of all the valley that you provide don't you just as lifetime as a limitation why are you doing that you need to be thinking massive because again we're going to be achieving massive and again the only one that we place is the one that we place on ourselves and that limitation is the efficiency so. When for efficiency so the efficiency should be constantly in your mind the whole day of what am I doing you ever have that where you going to a room and you're like wait what the f*** what am I here for around and then you go your way out. Gyro screwdriver so that is the efficiency because we are understanding our thoughts actions again the thing I make I live on thought our feelings are actions are guilty to control that our ability to be 100% DB commit what we're doing he went out really committed maybe getting screwed up. Tell me another screwdriver and you go in and get distracted when you get something you're like and then eventually you just kind of wake me when am I supposed to be doing all supposed to be doing this so that is the efficiency if you're just committed and you're just going and your RPMs are just f****** going you're just producing you're just creating and everywhere you go you're picking up trash you just say hi you doing everything you're constantly being efficient in that Valley he will come back to you now. You again do we have to be money it doesn't that don't have to be faint it's all that positive energy yeah money or can't be positive energy if you look at it in that way how much money was how much are Ron and that's how much so what's all the way you think about it and the efficiency is very important because that's the ski that's the time that's one of the most important limitation in this reality that is time so the bats able to achieve what we want to achieve. Haitian is what we decide how fast do want to accomplish what we want to accomplish you work for those goals and if you really are. 100% full force 2 walking in to be doing in achieving your goals and you really are sold on your idea of what you can achieve if you do everything at your hundred percent you you're going to f****** achieve anything and everything you want to achieve okay and that's efficiency that's getting towards. View version of what we want to achieve that's getting there faster better achieving more getting more okay now efficiencies when efficiency where efficiency everywhere efficiency for work clothes for daily life for everything it should be everywhere it should be from the moment you open your eyes first take a shower shave through this do that and water stretch do this start your day or just your day going I got your coffee all. What is efficiency the more you're able to translate. See again to be your thoughts feelings are you able to better navigate and achieve everything once with cheap with the most efficient see if efficiency is everywhere in your mind in your world you want Edition see everywhere do you know where it will give it back to you cuz you'll figure it out asking efficiency why the efficiency why should be Celtics play in terms of do you want to achieve what you want to achieve now or later sooner or later I mean that's efficiency no more efficient you are the better the closer you are able to grab. Closer to you because that's efficient see you able to control your environment your go to control your reality because you know you you create your own reality if you can control your thoughts feelings and actions you even show you your spirit you understand yourself you produce all this value and you have all this good luck and all his Good Karma good positive energy always cock going back to you and you know what the f*** you want to be doing have this massive goals and that gives you to work even harder you're going to f****** cheat everything is the most efficiently pop I am. Now efficiency for time efficiency for energy and efficiency for space those aspects of efficiency are very important in life but also in your branding when you think about all of the valley all of the positive value I think it's efficient see now I can just be producing a video content and that's stuck on there any that's pretty efficient but you also need to be producing lots of more value if you really do get so much value you need to be getting that value back out into the community outing for the world in different ways. Turn yourself to doing one thing or holding yourself to one lane or one workflow or just one Avenue of doing things you want to be able to achieve everything you want to achieve efficiently and when you think of kind and efficiency time in deficiency don't have the energy that put in for that efficiency imagine a very efficient engine an engine that has a very high power being very high torque and it consumes a little amount of gasoline electricity now in magic the more the more you press down on. The faster it goes and the Warren control it is and the better it is now imagine that machine as your body as your Gram and the more you feed into it the more you can assume. It puts out. Energy. Good. Good output of that brand of that idea of yourself of your life so that is efficiency so programming your breath to the internet we went through Valley regency and net is scalability it's the mass of it in the bin how big you should do it all right so program your breath to the internet and it's going to be scalability and really massive
