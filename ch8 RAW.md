Reality in terms of networking and programming your brand TV internet so. I seen your reality when you document your reality when you send the message when you call when you actually make that physical. Connection. Digitally feel real connection we make that real connect they're working. When it actually happens okay no more you disseminate that information the more you spread that idea the more you connect with other people the more you are networking the more you're spreading ideas and again you spread that energy out into the universe Universal come back to you the people who want to go to her concert will consuming the people who want your services who benefit for her Services who really did you succeed your services are going to come to you okay they are coming to you you just said that energy and it comes to you so that is. Nation of reality think about it you can't just oh yeah you know I thought about him the other day and I hope he was doing good and I worked on something and you know I'm the one day I'll talk to him I'll talk to him again no it needs to be. Styles with people who want the best for you you need to be actively out there making that connection people are very busy in their lives okay unless they will provide lots of value or there's an exchange or there's something that they want to connect with you for some reason or another babies or do you want the experience I want to listen to your voicemail they want to be around you maybe they want to get something from Yuma do they want money experience from you maybe they want advice from you maybe they want you to talk to them maybe something. Now working okay so be at the surround yourself with people who want the best for you if you just have negative. Around you got to just always try the Coughlin suck blood they just suck the energy and they convert that positive energy into negative energy you know those people they can convert anything into negativity those people are cancer okay you need to get away from those people do not surround yourself with those people be so positive and be yourself and be confident lqr and provide so much energy. They literally can't handle it after they move away from you they need don't want you they think you're annoying you want to actively they think I'm dangerous they say they don't want you to change because then if you change then that means they have to change so those negative vampires they do you want that though want to be able to forgive you want to push them away you want to be able to track other people you want to be able to say a little guy f****** it should I was able to convert negative. Into my biggest supporters by providing so much positive wow oh my God that's awesome right so that working with tools resources other hypermedia appointments and scheduling so when you think of networking you basically have a name server if you have the people I do with a people Bronson brand first is you right gilbert the other person the way you categorize that and the way you're able to sort that information is name hideaway and Company phone number email maybe address and then notes about what makes them unique or their brand or what service or what keywords or what they mentioned to you or where you met them or the context okay that is the universal information that is used in networking to the basic idea like in Our Minds when we think of the idea of networking with big idea of connections with other people and we think of another person we literally have named what they do have a concert some little Know da wae just random things they're not really random it's all categories it's all can be categorized and if you place that there's all these different booking systems that you can use theirs office. There is different services that you have to pay there's every services that are free you can look at yourself the other calendar when you have a comment on your computer you can calendar on piece of paper on an actual calendar that you buy from Dollar and that is how you organize you have to use all your technology to most of your advantage so if you want to enter your enter the information of the networking off to a relationship date jordan XL she or a book or on your phones or you have to organize it again. Lies the more you're able to scale and communicate and share that energy and share those ideas and continue those strengthening those lines of communication and be able to share the real the resources and tools and get that. Cher. Provide that. Positive value and get it from the people who want the best for you because the idea of producing and people coming to you will happen but you have to do math together produce a lot again there's so much noise even if you produce one good YouTube a was going to do no good if no one finds it and it's better that you produce so much. Energy of all I could think of networking of using all the tools the most of your advantage and again office. A business premium is a very efficient way if you want to have your own booking system and you don't want to worry about the handling of it and setting it up and learning how to do the few different programming or you don't want to just manually do it yourself and you just won an automated process that's already you can contact me new things. And it's one of the services that we offer businesses to businesses is workflow optimization and the workflow optimization is the process of programming your DirecTV internet It sharing the light via the sharing of resources so when I think of the best way to most efficiently use your time energy and space is the ability to use the tools that we have the software the information to the most of our advantage and we do that through collecting data and be able to store and organize that information and use that data to most of our Advantage One communication for sharing a resource and for networking and finally the final information in terms of networking of surrounding yourself with people who want the best for you is surrounding yourself with con with the people with the the audio books. Messages. Those people who are already successful who are where you want to be and Beyond who can help you those giants those leaders those people surround yourself with that surround yourself with their content hours on top of hours on top of hours of content and they're literally there because they're putting their perspective out into the world and you have that ability to connect that surround yourself with him now gif some negative people that just put out negativity and if you feel I want to listen to music feels like I feel bad I only feel like God. Don't surround yourself with that but when you listen to someone or when you consume some con if you're energized and you understand and you have organized thoughts and you know what the f*** you want to do and you're motivated and you're learning and you're growing and you're expanding your life to continue to live your best life if you get all those feelings are you canceling the content then f****** continue surround yourself getting I'm going to give you some recommendations so first grind card don't consume anything and everything of Grant Cardone 10x rule seller be sold if you're not first you're last 10 be obsessed or be average YouTube all of his content aldi's audiobooks consuming be a part of it like you said swim in the Kool-Aid don't just drink it Joe Rogan Joe Rogan is good for entertainment as well as education when you have physicist on but when he had lots of comedians it is sometimes a little spinning spinning the wheels.
